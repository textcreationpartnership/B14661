            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                           </note> yet hee granteth that those words <hi>[This is my body] may imply either such a reall change of the bread, as the Catholiques hold; or such a figurative change, as the Calvinists hold.</hi> And although hee would seeme to prove that the words of Scripture are so plaine, that they may compell a refractorie man to beleeve them, yet having well weighed the reasons and allegations of other Schoole-men, at last concludes: <hi>It may justly be doubted,</hi>

                           <hi>whether the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:177104:24"/> text be cleere enough to inforce it, seeing men sharp and learned (such as Scotus was) have thought the contrary.</hi> How therefore your Church should ground a point of faith upon a doubtfull opinion, or on such words as by the testimonies of your best learned Divines may receive a double construction, I leave it to be judged.</p>
                        <p>But farther in proofe of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> Creed, <hi>I could urge</hi> S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Humfrey</hi> (say you) <hi>with the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles appointed by the authoritie of the Church of England, to be uniformely taught by all Ministers, which they are to sweare unto; which Articles, though they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed new coyned, as the foundation of a new Church, yet</hi> S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Humfrey being his mothers Champion, will not (I suppose) yeeld her, or her doctrine to bee new.</hi> Thus you.</p>
                        <p>It is true as you say, there are 39. <hi>Articles</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by our Church, to bee uniformely taught by all Ministers: and it is as true that they are publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and received with unitie and consent (which your men acknowledge for a proper marke of the true Church.) And withall, let me adde this one thing for your observation (and indeed it is a thing remarkable) whereas all your <hi>Trent</hi> Articles have beene questioned, and confuted by <hi>Chemnitius, Chamierus, Gentilletus,</hi> and other Protestant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet there was never any Papist could goe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than to tell us, as you doe, I could urge you with the novelty of the 39. <hi>Articles.</hi> I say, never as yet did any Romanist attempt, much lesse was able to confute and overthrow our <hi>Articles,</hi> which stand
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:177104:24"/> like a house built upon a rocke, immoveable, and cannot be shaken.</p>
                        <p>Let me tell you further, your comparisons betwixt our <hi>Articles</hi> and yours doe not hold; for all your Articles are fundamentall points to your <hi>Trent</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and the deniall of any of them makes them heretiques, and damned persons, as your Popes Bull expressely declareth. On the other side,<note place="margin">Bulla Pii quarti.</note> some of our <hi>Articles</hi> concerne the discipline of the Church, and are not essentiall to salvation; others concerne the ancient and latter heresies, wherein we teach the negative, and those are not properly <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> of faith which we beleeve, but points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which wee condemne, and beleeve not. And that you may know our Articles are not new, nor newly coyned by our men; if you will put on your spectacles, you shall finde that most of our prime <hi>Articles</hi> are taught and received by your owne Church, as well as ours; and therefore I hope you will confesse they are not coyned, and built upon the foundation of a new Church.</p>
                        <p>Briefly touching our 39. <hi>Articles.</hi> The first sort are in the Affirmative, both ours and yours; and all those are uniformely received by both Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The second sort are ours onely, which we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and you deny: and those are very few in number, and are evidently deduced from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The third sort are yours, which we deny, and you affirme; and for that cause you terme our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion negative; and those remaine for you to make good. Joyne therefore those negative <hi>Articles,</hi>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:177104:25"/> which are wholly yours, to those positive <hi>Articles</hi> which you hold with us, and you shall easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne (if the denomination followeth the greater part) those <hi>Articles</hi> may most properly bee termed <hi>Articles</hi> of your faith; for I dare confidently avow that of the 39. <hi>Articles,</hi> there are above 35. yours, that is, either such which you hold with us, which are at least twentie, or such wherein the affirmative is yours, and not ours, which are at least fifteene: take therefore your owne libertie, either confute ours, or make good your owne, <hi>&amp; herbam porri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemus,</hi> and I will give you the bucklers.</p>
                        <p>You proceed, and upon a false supposall, that our Church hath created new Articles, you proclaime in the name of your owne Church these words: <hi>We teach that for Articles of faith, the Church can make none, as she cannot write a Canonicall booke of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Thus you.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Diogenes</hi> saw a supposed Bastard casting stones in a presse of much people, he gave the boy this caveat: <hi>Take heed lest thou hit thy father.</hi> This is like to bee your case; for by this <hi>Tenet</hi> you will wound the Church your <hi>Mother,</hi> and amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers you will surely hit your holy <hi>Father</hi> the Pope.</p>
                        <p>It appeares first, that you endevoured to shew, that your Church hath created no new Articles of faith, but for want of solid proofes you begin to faint, and thinke it the safest way to turne Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in this point, and say, <hi>the Church can create none:</hi> but I wonder how you dare pronounce in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:177104:25"/> the name of the Church <hi>(we teach)</hi> whereas in truth your Church teacheth it not. This is therefore but a cunning device of yours, to dazle the eyes of the ignorant with your false glasses, and to make them beleeve it is the generall <hi>Tenet</hi> of your Church; and then you thinke they will conclude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Assertion: <hi>Ergo, The Church hath created none;</hi> when as your saying makes more strongly against you, if either your Articles prove new, or the Pope and his Agents professe the contrarie.</p>
                        <p>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Heigham,</hi> who first answered my Book,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Heigham</hi> in his answer called <hi>Via verè tuta, pag.</hi> 199. <hi>&amp;</hi> 200.</note> was a member of your Church, and he cries aluod, that <hi>the Church hath power to decree, and promulgate new articles of faith:</hi> But your third Replyer, <hi>Tom Tell-troth,</hi> in his <hi>Whetstone of Reproofe,</hi> thought it the wisest way to decline the question; for hee knew well when you were both at odds, and taught flat contrarie doctrine each to other, the <hi>Whetstone</hi> of necessitie would belong to one of his fellow writers. But to let passe such differences amongst your selves; bee it spoken to your comfort, Friar <hi>Walden,</hi> about two hundred yeares agoe, affirmed the same that you doe,<note place="margin">Waldens doct.

                           </note> viz. that <hi>the Church could not create a new article of faith: How can any such article</hi> (saith he) <hi>framed after many yeares, be catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and universall, when as it was unknowne to our fore-fathers for foureteen hundred yeares before? It was not beleeved, because not heard of, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tels us, faith commeth by hearing. Such an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle therefore, although it be of faith, yet it cannot be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:177104:26"/> catholique:</hi> and this hee proves directly from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councels. And whereas you affirme, that your Church can no more make an article of faith, than shee can make a Canonicall Booke of Scripture;<note place="margin">Canus loc.

                           <hi>Canus,</hi> your Bishop of <hi>Canaries,</hi> will joyne with you, That <hi>the Church of the faithfull now living cannot write a Canonicall Booke of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> and hee gives the reason for it; <hi>There are not now any new revelations to be expected, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Pope, or from a Councell, or from the universall Church:</hi> and from hence it will follow of consequence by your owne Logick; <hi>Therefore the Church can create no new article of faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus farre I have waded in your behalfe, that you may the better justifie your owne Assertion; for you wil find your Church is like a house divided against it selfe (and therefore cannot stand long). I say that <hi>Quere</hi> which was made in <hi>Waldens</hi> dayes, was resolved above two hundred yeares before by your profound Schoole-man <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> in your Churches behalfe, that the Pope had power <hi>Condere articulos fidei,</hi> to create new articles of faith; to remove therefore these fig-leaves with which you would cover the naked truth: This learned Doctour well understood that there were many new articles of religion crept into the Church in his dayes; he knew well, that (albeit he were the prime Schoole-man of his time) yet with all his sophistrie hee could not make them comply with the ancient Catholique faith: and thereupon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:177104:26"/> he thought it the surest way, to give the Pope an absolute and independant power over faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and accordingly resolved,<note place="margin">Ad solam au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatem summi Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis pertinet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va Editio Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli, sicut &amp; alia omnia quae pertinent ad to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam Ecclesiam.

                        <p>I will not take advantage of your first Assertion, that your faith is grounded upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles (which you can never prove;) but wil joyne issue with you upon your last <hi>Assumpsit, That is only to be called a new faith, which is cleane of another kind, and is different &amp; disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what was taught before:</hi> but such are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Articles of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> as shall appeare by proofes at large in their proper places. In the meane time let me tell you, your Church teacheth not onely <hi>Novè,</hi> but <hi>Nova,</hi> not onely <hi>Praeter,</hi> but <hi>Contra,</hi> even besides, and contrarie to that which she first received from the ancient Church: so that howsoever you seeke to darken truth by faire and specious pretences, yet in truth your <hi>Trent</hi> Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are forraine to the faith, as neither principles nor conclusions of it. And that you may know and acknowledge with us, that your <hi>Trent</hi> faith is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and disagreeing from what was taught be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; I pray call to mind your owne confessions touching these particular Articles of your Roman Church.</p>
                        <p>Your doctrine touching Lay-peoples communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating under one kind (namely in bread onely) is an Article of the <hi>Roman</hi> faith, and now generally taught and practised in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: but this practice, by your owne confession, is different and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:177104:28"/> disagreeing from what was taught before: for you say, pag. 253. touching the Authors which you bring for proofe, <hi>That it was the common practice of the Church, for the Laytie to communicate in both kinds.</hi> I allow of their authoritie.</p>
                        <p>Your Prayer and Service in an unknown tongue, as it is now used in the Roman Church, by your owne confession is different and disagreeing from what was taught before; for, say you pag. 270. <hi>It is true,</hi> that <hi>Prayer and Service in the vulgar tongue was used in the first and best ages, according to the precept of the Apostles, and practice of the Fathers.</hi> In the beginning it was so.</p>
                        <p>Your doctrine of Transubstantiation, which at this day is generally received, <hi>de substantia fidei,</hi> for an Article of Faith, yet by your owne confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is different and disagreeing from what was taught before; for, say you pag. 167. <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiation might well be said not to have beene, de sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia fidei, in the Primitive Church, (as Yribarne speaketh) because it had not beene so plainly delivered nor determined in any Councell, till Gregorie the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth his time:</hi> and this was above a thousand yeares after Christ.</p>
                        <p>Your private or solitarie Masse, wherein the Priests doe daily communicate without the people, is by your own confession different and disagreeing from what was taught before and practised; for, say you pag. 191. <hi>They say</hi> (speaking of divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors) <hi>it was the practice of the Primitive Church to communicate everie day with the Priest.</hi> I grant it.</p>

                        <p>These points of controversie, which are so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly pursued by your men against the members of our Church, the strength and force of truth hath extorted from you, and therefore I may truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Ex ore tuo,</hi> from your owne confession, that your <hi>Trent</hi> faith is new, because it is different and disagreeing from what was taught before.</p>
                        <p>You that have taken an oath to maintaine the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie, and are so ready to teach others, you (I say) have either violated your oath, or at leastwise have forgot your old lesson, <hi>Oportet esse memorem, &amp;c.</hi> for verily it behoves him that speakes lyes and contradictions to have a good memorie. But it seemes you did conceive the Reader might easily passe by many such contradictions, being in severall passages, and farre distant pages. For otherwise it would seeme strange, that you, which so bitterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh against our reformed religion, should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the antiquitie of our Articles, and the noveltie of your owne, with flat contradictions to your owne Assertions.

                        <p>To pursue the rest of your Allegations: <hi>The Church of England</hi> (say you) <hi>admitteth of divers Books of the New Testament for Canonicall, whereof there was doubt of three or foure hundred yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Church of God, as the Epistle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, the second Epistle of St. Peter, the Epistle of St. Jude, the Apocalyps of St. John, and some others, which were after admitted for Canonicall; I would know of him whether upon the admittance of them, there were any change of faith in the Church, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever those books have received any change in themselves.</hi> Thus you.</p>
                        <p>It seemes you begin to feare that your <hi>Trent</hi> faith would be discovered to be different and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing from what was taught before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon you would seemingly illustrate the antiquitie of your new Articles by the authoritie of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Books of Canonicall Scripture. But, I pray, where doe you find that the Books of the New Testament, as namely, the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the Epistle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Jude,</hi> and the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps,</hi> were not received (for three or foure hundred yeares) for Canonicall? It is true there was some doubt who were the right Authors of those Books, but their divine authoritie was ever generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by all Christian Churches, and allowed for Canonicall. The Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> was therefore doubted of by some, because the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence &amp; diversity of the stile made them think it not to be St. <hi>Pauls;</hi> and by others, because the Author of it seemed to them to favour the error of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatian</hi>
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:177104:30"/> heretikes, in denying the reconciliation of such as fall after Baptisme: The second Epistle of St. <hi>Peter</hi> (which you speake of) some doubted of, because of the diversitie of the style: The Epistle of St. <hi>Jude</hi> was doubted, because the Author of it hath borrowed both the matter and manner of writing from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and therfore he was thought some scholar of theirs, but no Apostle. Others said he brought in a profane Author, concerning the strife of the Arch-angell and the Devill about the body of <hi>Moses,</hi> which cannot be found in Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scripture. Lastly, the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi> was likewise doubted of; first, because of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veltie of the title of <hi>John</hi> the Divine: secondly, because of the difficultie and obscuritie of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies. These and the like reasons were motives to some in the Church, to question the Authors of those Books: but it was never generally impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. For further proofe of this Assertion, let an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie be heard, and it will appeare, that all those Bookes were cited for doctrine of faith, by the writers of the first ages, and consequently were approved from, and after the dayes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.<note place="margin">Hieronym. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                        <p>Thus you see the Catholique Christians, and most ancient Fathers in the first ages received both the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the second Epistle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Epistle of St. <hi>Jude,</hi> and the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> with one consent, accounting them no better than <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which either doubted of them, or denyed them: and yet you, to outface the truth, would make the world beleeve, that it was three or foure hundred yeares before they were received into the Church, and made canonicall; and upon this vaine supposall you would know of me, <hi>Whether there were any change of faith in the Church when they were admitted, or whether those Books re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any change in themselves.</hi>

                        <p>To answer you in a word, your proposition is foolish, and your question is frivolous; for those Books were alwayes received, even from the first times: and no more could that word of God bee changed, than God himselfe, who is immutable; and yet we see your faith is daily altered, for want of that foundation, and thereupon it behoves you to get more, and better proofes, for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your new Creed.</p>
                        <p>From your justification of your <hi>Trent</hi> faith, you begin to looke asquint thorow your Spectacles at the reformed Churches, and after your wonted manner you crie out, <hi>They have no certaine rule of faith wherewith wee may urge them; authoritie of Church they have none: Scripture they have indeed, but so mangled, corrupted, perverted by translation, and mis-interpreted according to their owne fancies, that as they have it it is as good as nothing.</hi> Thus you.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>It is true</hi> (say you) <hi>Scripture you have indeed, but mangled, corrupted, perverted by translation.</hi> Here your charge is generall, and your accusation capitall; therefore you must give me leave, for the better discoverie of the truth, to send out a <hi>Melius inquirendum,</hi> that your Translation and ours being compared in particulars, the truth may better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
                        <p>First then it cannot be denyed, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in all their Translations have a recourse still to the Originall of <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired by the Holy Ghost; and these they preferre before all <hi>Latine</hi> and Vulgar Translations whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:<note place="margin">Bibl.

                           <hi>Not</hi> (saith <hi>Bellarmine) that the rivers of Translations should be preferred before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Hebrew and Greeke of the Prophets and Apostles, but because the fountaine is muddie in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, which otherwise should runne cleare; for without doubt, as the Latine Church hath beene more constant in keeping the faith than the Greeke, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it hath beene more vigilant in preserving her bookes from corruption.</hi>

                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:177104:32"/>
                        <p>These Paradoxes doe open a gap to Atheisme; for if the originall Scripture be corrupted, what as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, what certaintie can wee have of true faith and religion?

                        <p>To examine your Translation in generall, and so descend into the particulars of yours and ours. First, it is decreed by the Councell of <hi>Trent, that amongst divers Translations then in use, the old and vulgar Translation should be declared to be authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall in all publike Lectures,</hi>

Bishops at the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Councell.</p>
                        <p>From hence ariseth the first <hi>Quere,</hi> which of St. <hi>Hieromes</hi> Translations your Church doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (for St. <hi>Hierome</hi> confesseth that the first was corrupt, and accordingly he did correct many things in his first Translation.) To this Objection your Cardinall makes this faire and free confession;<note place="margin">Bell. de verbo Dei, l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi>
                           </note>
                           <hi>Although Hierome did perceive some things fit to be changed, and afterwards did change them, yet the Church did adjudge the first translation for true, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:177104:33"/> chose rather to keep that for the vulgar Edition. And</hi> then he concludes: <hi>Although the greatest part of the vulgar Translation be</hi> Hieromes, <hi>yet it is not that pure Edition which he translated out of the Hebrew, but in a manner mixt.</hi>
                        </p>

                           </note> yet (saith he) <hi>wee ingenuously confesse that many errours were corrected by</hi> Hierome <hi>in the old Translation, and likewise there are found in our new Editions some falsifications, solecismes, barbarismes, and many things ambiguous, not well expressed in the</hi> Latine; <hi>some things changed, other things omitted; and the like.</hi> Here both confesse that <hi>Hieromes</hi> first Translation was erroneous, (and the one saith that your Church hath chosen that which is not pure nor agreeable to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the other confesseth it hath Barbarismes and untruths.) To speake inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously, the Sunne never saw any thing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and maimed than the vulgar Latine.

                        <p>From hence will arise a second <hi>Quere,</hi> whether this Translation of <hi>Sixtus</hi> were that <hi>Hieromes</hi> Translation formerly confirmed, and ratified by the <hi>Trent</hi> Councell. If it were his, and confirmed by a Generall Councell, how came it to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by <hi>Sixtus?</hi> If it were not the same, how could <hi>Sixtus</hi> Bible be allowed by a Decree made in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> (for so are the words of his <hi>Bull</hi>) whereas the Councell was called <hi>Anno</hi> 1545. and <hi>Sixtus</hi> published his Bible <hi>Anno</hi> 1592. which was above 40. yeares after the Councell was called? But observe the sequell; The Decree of <hi>Sixtus</hi> was kept inviolable for a short time, and approved by <hi>Urban</hi> the 7<seg rend="sup">th</seg>, <hi>Gregory</hi> the 14<seg rend="sup">th</seg>, and <hi>Innocent</hi> the 9<seg rend="sup">th</seg> his immediate Successors: But
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:177104:35"/> Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>eight,</hi> about seaven yeares after the death of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> called in question that Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and published another of his owne, <hi>Ad perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuam rei memoriam,</hi> and corrects <hi>Sixtus</hi> Bible, under this pretence;<note place="margin">Clem. in praef. Sixti Bibl.</note> that <hi>his Predecessor percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not a few things to have crept into the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble through default of the Presse, and that it needed a second care, and that certainly he himselfe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bring the whole worke to the Presse againe, had he not beene prevented by death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These two Editions were published by two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Popes, and both commanded to be read and followed in their severall <hi>Breves:</hi> Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> disclaimes all Bibles whatsoever, both Manuscripts and printed, of the vulgar Edition, which did not agree with his Edition <hi>Ad literam,</hi> to a letter. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> professeth that his Translation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not absolutely perfect in all points, yet without doubt it is more pure, and better cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected than any other that was published before it. In conclusion, both agree that the <hi>Forme of each must be inviolably observed without the least particle of the Text added,</hi>

                        <p>Now take your choyce of which Translation you please; if you allow <hi>Sixtus,</hi> it was corrected in many places by Pope <hi>Clement;</hi> if <hi>Clements,</hi> you must incurre the curse of his Predecessor Pope <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi> if you will receive the vulgar Translation, which you terme St. <hi>Hieromes,</hi> your Cardinall tels you it is not of his purest Edition. Lastly, if you approve the vulgar Edition, decreed by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:177104:35"/> of <hi>Trent,</hi> I say neither you, nor all the Papists living, can resolve which is that vulgar Edition.</p>
                        <p>For a Conclusion, either your vulgar Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before <hi>Clements</hi> time was corrupt, or in vaine did <hi>Clement</hi> command a <hi>Correctorium</hi> to passe upon it, and to be read according to that correction. The worke of <hi>Lucas Brugensis,</hi> who was living at that time, hath sufficiently discovered your corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Bible of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> which in his time was <hi>reputed for that onely Edition confirmed by the</hi> Trent <hi>Councell, commanded to be read throughout all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and allowed by the consent of the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church:</hi> this Bible (I say) which for many ages was reputed the onely authenticall Edition in your Church, is purged and corrected (I speake within compasse) in above 3000 severall places. And as it hath beene observed by a painfull labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in that Vineyard,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Iames</hi> in his <hi>Bellum Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pale.</hi>

                        <p>We reade in the 34. of <hi>Exodus</hi> and the last verse, <hi>The Children of Israel saw the face, that the skinne of</hi> Moses <hi>face shone:</hi>

                        <p>In the 11 of St. <hi>Luke</hi> you have maymed and falsified the Lords Prayer: you say in this manner; <hi>Father sanctified be thy name, thy Kingdome come, our dayly bread give us this day, and forgive us our sinnes, for because our selves also doe forgive every

                           <hi>Faith is now come to depend rather on time, than on the Gospel, your state is dangerous and miserable: you have as many faiths as wills, and as many doctrines as manners; whilst faiths are either so written as you list, or so vnderstood as you will.</hi>

                        <p>I come now to your forbidden Bookes, wherein the mysterie of iniquitie: will manifestly appeare:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:177104:40"/> and first touching the sacred <hi>Bible</hi> which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the first place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Bible</hi> (say you) <hi>is not so forbidden, but that it is in the Bishops power to grant leave, if upon Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Parish Priest or Confessor of the partie that desireth leave, he finde him to be such a one as may not incurre danger of faith, &amp;c. which with any reasonable man may be counted sufficient liberty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is true that by the fourth Rule of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, the <hi>Bible</hi> may be licensed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, but the party must have the license in writing: and withall it is decreed,<note place="margin">Regula <hi>4.</hi> in indice libr. prohibit. p. <hi>16.</hi>
                           </note>
                           <hi>If any presume without such license either to reade or have it, unlesse he come in first and give up his Bible to his Ordinary, let him not have the pardon of his sinnes.</hi> It is not lawfull then to reade the Bible without a dispensation, but with a license any man may reade it: and <hi>this</hi> (say you) <hi>is sufficient liberty for any reasonable man.</hi> If I should grant you that which you say, yet you are never able to make good that license: for Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>eight</hi> about thirty yeares after, upon this dispensation so granted, gives us to understand, That upon the Rule of <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>fourth,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Observatio cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae <hi>4.</hi> Regulam Ibid. p. <hi>22.</hi> in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Concil. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note>
                           <hi>no new power was granted to the Bishops, or Inquisitors, or Superiors, to license the buying, reading, or keeping the Bible in the vulgar tongue; seeing hitherto by the command and practise of the holy Inquisition, the power of granting such licenses, to reade or keepe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in the vulgar Language, or any part of Scripture, as well of the New as the Old Testament, or any sums or Hystoricall Abridgement of the same in any vulgar
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:177104:40"/> Language hath beene taken from them: Quod qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem inviolatè servandum est;</hi> and this is inviolably to be observed. You see then, that howsoever your <hi>Pius</hi> Pope gave a dispensation for the reading of the Scriptures: yet Pope <hi>Clement</hi> his Successor, declared that license to be void and of none effect; and that which concludes your Assertion for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, it was by him decreed, to bee kept without any dispensation or violation.<note place="margin">Inviolatè ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandum.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus touching the sacred Bible you have severall Translations, upon severall paines to be received, and both different each from other in many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places: you have ranked the sacred Bible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Bookes prohibited; and lastly, you see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly grant a license for the Ignorant to reade the Scripture: and by another decree you abridge that license so granted. I proceed from the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Scriptures, to your purging and falsifying of the ancient Fathers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>As for Fathers</hi> (say you) <hi>it is most grossely false which the Knight after the ordinary Ministeriall tune, stands canting, that we blot out and raze them at our pleasures. What is it then that these men would have? What is it they can carpe at? Nothing but that they themselves are stung, in that hereby they are kept either from publishing their owne wicked workes, or corrupting the Fathers at their pleasure; and to wipe away this blemish from themselves, would lay it upon us.</hi> Thus you.</p>
                        <p>It seemes you have beene well acquainted with Rogues and sturdy Beggers, who have taught you
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:177104:41"/> the Terme of <hi>(Canting)</hi> a word proper for such kinde of people: but whereas you say it is grosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly false that you blot and raze the Fathers, and that therein we seeke to wipe away the blemish from our selves, and lay it upon you; for the better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of the truth, first, looke I pray upon the place where the corrupted Fathers were printed, &amp; see by whom they were licensed; then heare your owne men witnessing their owne confession, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them; and lastly, peruse the places which I shall produce razed and corrupted, and then tell me if the Mysterie of Iniquity doth not closely worke in your <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and that the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are grossely falsified, and notoriously cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by your owne men, even in the principall points of Doctrine controverted betwixt us.</p>
                        <p>First then wee must observe, that corruptions and abuse of ancient Fathers may be of three sorts; either by foisting into the Editions bastard Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and intitling them to the Fathers; or by falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their undoubted Treatises by additions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, or mutations; or lastly, by alledging passages, and places out of them, which are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in their workes: and of all these three kindes your men are guilty,<note place="margin">Expurgari &amp; emaculari curâsti om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corū scriptorū, praecipuè vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Patrum scripta.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:177104:41"/> especially those of the ancient Fathers, to bee purged.</hi> And <hi>Gretzerus</hi> your Jesuit proclaimes it by way of justification;<note place="margin">Gretz. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>10</hi>

                           <hi>that Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script Books are also to be purged, as well as printed;</hi> which shewes your good intention to the ancient Writers. I may adde to these, that you doe not onely purge, and corrupt the Fathers (as shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in matter of fact in severall Ages) but you forge Bastard Epistles in the names of ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and you thrust counterfeits into the Chayre of the true and Catholike Doctors. <hi>Peter Warbeck</hi> is taken for <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and obscure Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, as namely <hi>Dorotheus, Hormisda, Hermes, Hypolitus, Martialis,</hi> and other counterfeits, for famous Writers, and all to supply your defects of doctrine in the Orthodox Fathers. <hi>Severinus Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> hath published certaine decretall Epistles in the names of <hi>Clemens, Anacletus, Evaristus, Sixtus,</hi> and many others, to the number of thirty one, all Bishops of <hi>Rome:</hi> Insomuch, as their Epistles are cited by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> by <hi>Peresius,</hi> by <hi>Coccius,</hi> by <hi>Baronius,</hi> by your <hi>Rhemists,</hi> for severall proofes of your <hi>Trent</hi> Doctrine. <hi>Gratian</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Grat.

                        <p>Whether to forge a false deed, or to raze a true one, be the greater fault, it is not greatly materiall: for your owne men are guilty of both. And lastly, when neither purging, nor falsifying will serve the turne (which you have practised in Bookes set out the first 800. yeares) you bring a Prohibition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Authors, Priests, and Professors in the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:177104:42"/> bosome of your owne Church, which testifie the truth of our doctrine, and injoyne them silence by your <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> by cutting out their tongues, and refining them with a new impression; and this hath beene your ordinarie practice, for the last 800. yeares.

                           <hi>Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Eucharist cannot be tasted with the hand, but was wont anciently to be carried with the hand, I thought it best to change the word</hi> Tasting, <hi>into</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying; <hi>which I borrowed from an ancient Copie in</hi> Cambron Abbey. The word then we see was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his owne Confession, and the <hi>Cambron</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie is brought for the defence of this forgerie: which differing from all other Copies may be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suspected. For his reason, that <hi>we taste not with our hand,</hi> it is frivolous: For St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith not, <hi>gustatam manu,</hi> but simply <hi>gustatam;</hi> which taste yet was not without taking the Sacrament into the hand.</p>

                        <p>Now let us looke backe, and examine the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of these several Editions and falsifications.

Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies the Additions were not to be found. Mr. <hi>Hart</hi> saith, the true Copie was printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Popes command, and with the advise of vertuous and wise men, to be perfectly corrected, and free from all spots. <hi>Pamelius</hi> saith, it was better than any other; but withall, it was not so exact, but that the old Proverbe might take place, the <hi>latter is commonly the better.</hi> Lastly, touching the razing out the Epistle of <hi>Firmilianus, Pamelius</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that his Copie (which doth cite it) <hi>is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Indiculus Codi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum in initio Cypriani.</note>
                           <hi>that, be it spoken without envie, there will need no further recognition; yet happely</hi> (saith he) <hi>it had beene better it had never come forth.</hi>

                        <p>In the first Age you have depraved the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by your false translations and corruptions; and when all could not save your turne, you place the <hi>Bible</hi> amongst the Bookes prohibited.</p>
                        <p>In the second Age you have forged Epistles in the names of 31. Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> which were none of theirs; and to suppresse our Doctrine touching the Communion in both kinds, and to uphold your invocation of Saints and Angels, you have corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Ignatius</hi> by a false Translation; and you would have the Record razed touching the marriage of Priests.</p>
                        <p>In the third age you corrupt <hi>Tertullian</hi> for your Transubstantiation; you falsifie Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> for your circumgestation of the Sacrament, and your Popes supremacie.</p>

                        <p>In the fift Age you have razed two evidences in Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> both which confirme our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the one concerning the Lords Supper, the other concerning our tryall by the Scriptures: you have falsified the Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> for the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of women, and for the shaving of Priests: you have falsified Saint <hi>Austin</hi> for your Purgatory, and for your Doctrine of Transubstantiation, and your Popes decretall Epistles: you have forged the Councell of <hi>Africa</hi> for the honour of your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicke See: you have forged Saint <hi>Cyrill</hi> for your Transubstantiation, and your Popes Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
                        <p>In the sixt Age you have corrupted the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Orange</hi> for your Doctrine of merits, and for the honour of your Priesthood over secular powers.</p>
                        <p>In the seventh Age you have razed <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> touching the comming of Antichrist; you have purged him in an Epistle which maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Popes Supremacie: you have falsified the Councell of <hi>Constantinople</hi> in your Popes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.</p>

                           <hi>except a manifest error appeare to have crept in by the fraud of Hereticks or negligence of the Printer.</hi> Sure I am you will confesse that all these mentioned corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not <hi>Errata,</hi> slips of the Printer; And as touching the fraud of Heretickes which did corrupt them, your <hi>Trent</hi> Councell (which made the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree) could not meane the Protestants: for in those dayes they had printed no Fathers, neither had they any Manuscripts, but such as were kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners in your Church: The name of Heretickes therefore doth properly reflect upon your Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> upon <hi>Gratian,</hi> upon <hi>Stapleton,</hi> upon <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas,</hi> upon Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be Authors of your falsifications; and in generall upon your <hi>Roman</hi> inquisitors, who are the knowne Authors of your corrupting and altering the true Fathers. And this must needes seeme very probable to all, because they are corrupted chiefely in those main Articles of Faith which make against
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:177104:57"/> your Church. The ancient Records and Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which you have had many hundred yeeres in your possession, doe all witnesse these forgeries and corruptions in the printed Fathers, and will you claime the Fathers for your Rule of Faith, when you make them speake more like children than fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Shall a Guardian to an infant, having pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of his Lands, and keeping his Deeds and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences during his minoritie, raze and falsifie them, and thereby intitle himselfe to the Wards Lands, because hee was some time possessed of them, and can produce forged Evidences for them? This is our very case: The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in her infancie was a faithfull Guardian of her childrens right, shee kept the Manuscripts and the ancient Records of the Fathers, in that puritie as she first received thē; after the Pope had made an universall Title and claime to all Catholike Churches, hee intruded into other mens Rights by forgerie and corruptions, he made the Fathers speake according to the <hi>Trent</hi> decrees, in an unknowne tongue, and now by forged cavilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion detaines the possession against the right own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

                        <p>Thus much touching the razing and corrupting of the Fathers for the first 800. yeares. Now I proceed to your <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and blotting out the moderne Authours for the last 800. yeares.</p>

                        <p>But tell mee in good sooth, if those places of Scriptures and Fathers did make for your Religion, would you purge them? Or must we beleeve, that your Inquisitors would take such infinite care and paines to review all Authours for 1600. yeares, and spunge them onely in the <hi>Index?</hi> Without doubt that man who doth willingly deface the Kings picture, stamped in his coyne, would, if he durst, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it upon his person: the Tables of Authors, and Glosses, were especially intended for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Reader, both for his better understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and his more speedie searching of the truth.</p>
                        <p>They resemble the <hi>Phylacteries</hi> of the Jewes, which had a Ribband of <hi>Blue</hi> upon the borders of their garments, that by them they might the better remember the Commandements of God: he that would have cut the fringes of those garments in those dayes, to prevent the remembrance of Gods law, would (no doubt) have offered violence to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, on which God himselfe had written, if hee durst attempt it. The truth is, the words imprinted in the skirts and tables of your Bibles and Fathers,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:177104:60"/> are thornes in your eyes, and goades in your sides: and from hence we may easily discerne, why you leave out the second Commandement, and alter the fourth in your <hi>Psalters</hi> and <hi>Breviaries,</hi> which you dare not alter in your Bibles. And that your Assertion may more particularly appeare to bee most untrue, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>you purge no Authours before the yeare</hi> 1515.

                        <p>First therefore the Reader shall understand, that your <hi>Roman</hi> Inquisitors have published an <hi>Index</hi> of prohibited Bookes, and in that <hi>Index</hi> they have divided the Authors into three severall <hi>Classes,</hi> or orders.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Classis.</hi> 1.</note> In the first they ranke all those Bookes which are adjudged by your men for Heretikes; as namely, <hi>Berengarius, Wickliffe, Luther, Cassander, Erasmus, Raynolds,</hi> and divers others; whose Bookes not onely now written, but whatsoever shall be published in their names hereafter, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited as Hereticall.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Classis.</hi> 2.</note> In the second <hi>Classis</hi> they have ranked all those whose doctrine is not very sound, but suspected, and <hi>offensive,</hi> although the Authors themselves never forsooke the Church, and therefore not personally to bee noted: and of this sort are <hi>Charles the great, Agobardus, Bertram, Huldericus, Cajetan,</hi> and divers others, whose Bookes are now purged; and some of them lived 800.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Classis.</hi> 3.</note> years since. The third is of namelesse Authors, which (say they) deliver pernitious doctrine, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:177104:60"/> are condemned by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and those onely which have beene published without a name since the yeare 1584.</p>
                        <p>These three rankes of Classicall Authors, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Adversaries doome, may be desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to these three severall places. The first sort to <hi>Hell,</hi> which containes the Heretikes and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned persons, never to be redeemed. The second sort to <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which are suspended and restrained upon suspicion of false doctrine, or veniall sinne, and must not be freed till they be purged, and have payd the utmost farthing to the Pope. The third, to <hi>Limbus Infantum,</hi> and those are <hi>Anonymoi,</hi> such as were unbaptized, and have beene published with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a name, from the yeare 1584. Of these three sorts, I will produce onely the Authors of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Classis,</hi> which lived and died members of your Church, such as were never condemned for heresie, but (touse your own words) have <hi>Suspectam Doctrinam,</hi> that is to say in plaine English, <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Doctrine:</hi> whereof some you have purged in your new Editions, others you have forbidden to be read till they be purged:<note place="margin">

                        <p>I proceed: In the ninth age <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> wrote foure Bookes concerning Images; he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that hee began the worke in his owne King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and your owne <hi>Ecchius,</hi> and <hi>Luzenburgus,</hi> both witnesse that this Emperour wrote all those Bookes: yet your <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> layes hold on him, and forbids the worke; pretending that it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:177104:61"/>
                           <hi>is falsely ascribed to him,</hi> when as the true reason is, because he condemned Image-worship, and forbids the 7<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. Councell to be called either a generall, or lawfull Councell: for otherwise your owne <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi>

                           </note> who was living when these things were fresh in memorie, professeth, that a generall Synod was kept in <hi>Germany</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> and there, by the Rules of Scripture and doctrine of the Fathers, the false Councell of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> was confuted and utterly rejected; of whose confutation there was a good bigge Booke sent to <hi>Rome</hi> by certaine Bishops from <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> which in my youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger yeares I read in the Palace.</p>
                        <p>Now admit that <hi>Charles</hi> were not the Authour of those Bookes (although your owne men wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse he was) yet the Authour you see was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and living in that age; hee condemned your Image-worship, hee confuted the reasons of the <hi>Nicene Councell,</hi> and by this it appeares that your Church hath transgressed her limits above 700. yeares; and therefore your <hi>Trent</hi> decree was made sutable to your <hi>Spectacles,</hi> which makes that seeme to be, which is not.</p>

                           <hi>while</hi> Bertram <hi>is forbidden, I deny that a Father is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; for the Father is no naturall Father, but a Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, who nourisheth not the Church with wholesome food, but with darnell and pernitious graine together with the Wheate: wherefore as the Popes have dealt with some writings in</hi> Origen <hi>and</hi> Tertullian, <hi>by the same right may they now, according to their wisdome, abolish any writing of others, either in whole or in part by cutting or blotting them out.</hi> Thus first they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed with this ancient Author and our Doctrine; then they correct him in some passages, by speaking flat contrary to his owne meaning; and when all would not serve the turne, they absolutely forbid him to be read, or rather command him to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly blotted out, and totally suppressed.</p>

Shall I make you my Confessor? I cannot chuse but smile when I consider what great paines you have taken in this whole Chapter, to uphold the Articles of your Faith with sixe pretended rules, and all infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, as namely, Scripture in the plaine and literall sense; Tradition or common beliefe and practice of the whole Church; Councels either generall or particular, confirmed by the See Apostolike; the authoritie of that whole See it selfe defining <hi>Ex Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedra,</hi> though without either generall or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Councell; the common and uniforme consent of ancient Fathers or moderne Doctours and Schoole-men, delivering any thing unto us as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith: All these sixe rules (say you) <hi>we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and are ready to make good whatsoever is taught any of these wayes.</hi>

                        <p>It is true, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not bitter against Heretikes (as you understand them for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants) for they are no Heretikes: but if the termes of <hi>Luthers whelpes, Hell hounds</hi> of <hi>Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, damned persons, and worse than Infidels;</hi> if such termes (I say) be Catholike complements (which your fellow <hi>Jesuits</hi> have given us) I shall freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse your <hi>Charitie is mistaken.</hi>

                        <p>But (say you) <hi>the word Heretike, which is the worst of all, hath ever gone with such as have held new particular doctrines,</hi>

                        <p>Surely you have my assent and wishes with you, that is, that the name of Heretike may alwayes goe as it hath gone, with such as teach new and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian doctrine. But let me tell you, this descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yours is a perfect Character of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and I verily beleeve that if all the pictures and patternes of a Papist were lost in the world, they might all againe be recovered, and a Papist painted to the life in the description of such an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike as you here define.</p>
                        <p>Looke upon the particular doctrines of private Masse, your halfe Communion, your Prayer in an unknowne Tongue, and tell me if these be not new: why else doe you and your associates confesse that the contrary Tenets were taught and revived by the Ancients? And as touching the name of Antichrist, if that be appropriate to Heretikes, it cannot touch the members of our Church; for we make Christ and his Apostles the sole rule of our Faith. On the other side, if you consider the Pope, either as he sits in the place of Christ, as his Vicar Generall, or as he and his adherents teach and uphold a doctrine against Christ (for the word <hi>Antichrist</hi> imports both) without doubt they beare the markes of <hi>Antichrist,</hi>

The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles you know did reprove those errors in their dayes, and no doubt many accordingly did reforme themselves: Now will you condemne those reformed persons for Heretikes, because they differed from the rest with an utter dislike of those errors which the seduced partie retained? Surely this is the true state and condition of our Church; and accordingly your <hi>Trent</hi> Fathers made a decree for Reformation in the Councell, and pretended that it was summoned to redresse Heresies which were crept into the Church; and will you say, if they had redressed them, the <hi>Reformers</hi> had beene <hi>Heretikes?</hi>

                        <p>As this Author wrote a tract against Hereticks, so likewise he professeth that the head of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, as well as the members are subject to that capitall accusation whereof you accuse the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and particularly he doth instance from <hi>Platina</hi> in Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> for an Arrian Hereticke, and Pope <hi>Anastasius</hi> for a favourer of the <hi>Nestorian</hi>
                           <pb n="155" facs="tcp:177104:86"/> Heretickes, and withall hee resolves the question (which without all question is so to bee resolved) that the Pope (which you make one of the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Rules of your Faith) may become an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke.</p>
                        <p>You shall doe well therefore to forbeare your name <hi>[Catholicke]</hi> till you can free your Pope and his adherents from the markes of Heretickes.

And as for abusing of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> I assure you it was farre from my thoughts; and you cannot be ignorant that the inference, according to true meaning, standeth thus. If Protestants beleeve and hold all things necessarie for all Christians, then are they not to be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>damned persons, and worse than Infidels:</hi> But
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:177104:87"/> they beleeve the Apostles Creed, they teach the ten Commandements, and administer some few Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which in your Cardinals opinion are those things which are simply necessarie for all to know and beleeve; and to this argument you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere nothing, but you quarrell about words. When I translate <hi>[nonnulla] a few Sacraments,</hi> you say I falsifie <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> for the word <hi>(few)</hi> is not there; and yet you know well, that by <hi>nonnulla</hi> hee doth not meane <hi>omnia,</hi>

Secondly, with the contradiction of a former lye, he telleth a new one; for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was sought for manners onely, and not for doctrine.

                        <p>At <hi>Luthers</hi> first rising, which was almost 30. yeares before the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> your <hi>Guicciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Guicciard. Hist. lib. <hi>13.</hi>
                           </note> that there were that yeare many mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings at <hi>Rome,</hi> to consult what was best to be done.

                        </p>
                        <p>I come to the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> it selfe, where you may reade many decrees for reformation, and yet neither doctrine nor manners reformed. But let us heare your owne confession. <hi>It is true, the Councell indeed complaineth with great reason of the avarice of such whom the Knight calleth the Popes Collectors, though the Councell speaketh not of the Pope: but false it is which he saith, that the Councell complaineth of Indulgences, an Article of faith (as his words are.) The Councell likewise complaineth of many things crept into the celebration of the Masse, and the words of the Councell are right cited by him in Latin in the Margent, but in the English he foully corrupteth them: For in stead of</hi> many things, <hi>hee translated</hi> many errors, <hi>which is a grosse errour and corruption in the Knight.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These be your grand exceptions to the grosse corruptions laid unto my charge; but all this while you doe not discharge the accusations laid justly to your Church. And in this I must needs say, you play the Hypocrite, <hi>who can discerne a mote in your Brothers eye, and cannot see a beame in your owne:</hi> First therfore cast the beame out of your own eye, and then you shall easily disccrne without Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that the <hi>Collectors</hi> of <hi>Indulgences</hi> are the <hi>Popes Collectors,</hi> although the Pope is not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that place; and <hi>Indulgences</hi> are an Article of Faith created by that Councell, although the Councell proclaime it not an Article of Faith: so
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:177104:94"/> that <hi>(multa)</hi> many things, might well stand for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errors and corruptions, since they were errors in practise. Neither would I have set the Latin in the Margent if I had meant to corrupt them in English; and withall, if you had taken the last edition (as you ought to have done) you should have found them in another <hi>Character,</hi> and then all your waste words of <hi>foule corruptions,</hi> had beene needlesse. But in this you resemble <hi>Palladius</hi> a lewd fellow, who in like manner charged St. <hi>Hierome</hi> with falsifications and false translations: <hi>He preacheth and publisheth abroad</hi> (saith <hi>Hierome) that I am a falsarie,</hi>

                           <hi>The Councell</hi> (say you) <hi>seemeth to acknowledge the avarice of Priests in saying Masse for mony, was not farre from Symonie.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:177104:94"/> proceeding rather from superstition than true Religion.</hi> This you confesse is true in your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, but to these you answer nothing.<note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Sess. <hi>22.</hi> Can. <hi>9.</hi>

                        <p>I perceive your passion makes you much forget your selfe: for your doctrine (I confesse) which is commonly received, is the same now, that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent;</hi> but that is was ever the same, as now it is, all the Colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Jesuits cannot prove.

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:177104:95"/> For (say you) <hi>it was the practise of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church for the people to communicate every day with the Priest.</hi>

                           <hi>but also sacramentally:</hi> and doth not your Church in this wish a reformation in doctrine? Doth it not in this preferre the practice of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches before their owne, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner confesse an error in the allowed practice of the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> Your Councell commands Pastors that have care of soules, to expound that to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is delivered in the Masse in an unknowne tongue; and doe not those that require the Priests to expound it to the people, shew likewise that without such exposition the people are little better for the Masse, and that the Church intended the people should understand it? What is this else, but to joyne hands with the Protestants, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a reformation needfull in your Church, for requiring Service to bee celebrated in a knowne tongue, that the people may understand it? But that I may make good my assertion, and that the Reader may know I have said nothing but the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:177104:95"/> truth, in affirming the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> did make decrees for Reformation for doctrine as well as manners, looke upon the second <hi>Session,</hi> and tell me if they did not professe a reall intention in both.

                           </note>
                           <hi>Whereas it is the speciall care and intention of the Councell, that (the darkenesse of Heresie being expelled, which so many yeares hath covered the earth) the light and purity of the Catholicke truth may shine, through the helpe of Christ which is the true light; and that those things which need reformation may be reformed; the Synod exhorteth all Catholickes assembled, or to be assembled, and especially those who are skilful in the sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that with continuall meditation they may dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently consider with themselves how these things may bee effected; that they may condemne those things which are to be condemned, and approve those things which are to be approved, that the whole world with one mouth, and confession of one and the same faith, may glorifie God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Take a review of the words of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; First, <hi>Praecipua cura &amp; intentio, ut propulsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis errorum tenebris, quae per tot annos operiarunt terram;</hi> the chiefe care to dispell the darkenesse of errour which covered the earth: which words cannot be meant of the Protestant doctrine. For our light is pretended by you to be lately come in, and but in a part or corner of the world. Secondly, <hi>peritiam habeant sacrarum literarum, ut sedulâ me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatione secum ipsi cogitent, &amp;c. ut probare proban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, &amp; damnare damnanda queant.</hi> There needed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:177104:96"/> not this diligence and skill in Scriptures for <hi>Luthers</hi> Religion, for they were condemned before by the Pope. Thirdly, <hi>Nullus debeat &amp;c. obstinatis discep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationibus contendere,</hi> which should not be about <hi>Lutheran</hi> points, but about doctrines of their owne. Fourthly, in the third Section, <hi>de extirpandis hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resibus, &amp;c.</hi> which (say they) is <hi>adversus spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les nequitias in caelestibus,</hi> which heavenly places are meant by their owne Church, not by <hi>Luthers,</hi> as is most evident.

                        <p>Now I pray, what thinke you of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels Decrees? Will not they extend to a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in doctrine? or will you say that Heresies in manners crept into the Church, and the most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scriptures were chiefly to be imployed for reforming them, that thereby there might be one Faith of Papists and Protestants through the Christian world?<note place="margin">De extirpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis haeresibus, &amp; moribus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formandis, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum causa prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipue est con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregata.

Besides, to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:177104:96"/> what purpose were those disputes and oppositions in the Councell against particular points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, if they had not beene adjudged erroneous, and needed a reformation? But herein the Reader shall easily discerne the policie of your Church. At the first calling of the Councell (when these first Sessions were made) the number of Bishops were but few, (about 40.) but after the faction of the Popes creatures in multitude prevailed, all hope of reformation was abandoned; And thereupon the Bishops of <hi>Apulia</hi> publikely declared, that the <hi>Trent</hi> Fathers <hi>were nothing else but the Popes crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and his bondslaves;</hi>

                        <p>I shewed in my fourth Section, that many learned <hi>Romanists,</hi> convicted by evidence of truth, either in part, or in whole, renounced Poperie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their death.<note place="margin">

                           <hi>That some have renounced the same in part</hi> (say you) <hi>is foolishly said, for no man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Catholike Faith in part, it being indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If I shall prove your assertion to bee a strange Paradoxe, the foolishnesse will returne into your owne bosome. For the better illustration therefore of your Tenet,<note place="margin">Oratio in lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Athanasii.</note> heare what division <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> makes upon that ground: <hi>When one taketh
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:177104:98"/> up water in his hand</hi> (saith he) <hi>not onely that which he taketh not up, but that also which runneth forth, and findeth passage betweene his fingers, is divided and separated from that which he holdeth and incloseth in his hand: so not onely the open and professed enemies of the Catholike Faith, but they also that seeme to be her best and greatest friends, are sometimes divided one from another.</hi> What thinke you of this ancient Father? Is your Faith indivisible by his Doctrine? or will you say it is foolishly spoken of him? But (say you) <hi>he that ceaseth to beleeve one point, ceaseth to beleeve any one as he should:</hi> And is this wisely spoken thinke you? Is not this your latter error greater than the first? For proofe therefore of your assertion, shew mee that man, who before the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> held all the points of your Faith, as they are now taught and received in your Church; I say, give me but one since the Aposles time, who within the compasse of fifteene hundred yeares beleeved all your doctrines of Faith, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in all points, and for that one mans sake, I will confesse your Faith is <hi>indivisible,</hi> and submit my obedience to your Church.</p>
                        <p>Your <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> discovers the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your opinion: I speake not of Authors which were condemned in your first and third <hi>Classis</hi> for Heretikes, but of those <hi>Romanists</hi> who in the second <hi>Classis</hi> are purged for their <hi>suspected doctrine</hi> (as you terme it) and yet never forsooke your Church;<note place="margin">Propter suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam doctrinam Ind. lib prohibit.</note> I dare confidently avow, that there are above foure hundred of those Classicall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:177104:98"/> all members of the Roman Church, never excommunicated, never condemned for heresie in your Church, and yet are commanded by your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors to be blotted out in some particular points of doctrine, which make against your <hi>Trent</hi> Faith. If these men therefore have renounced your Faith in part, how is your Faith indivisible? Or If they cease to beleeve one point, why doth your Church cite their testimonies, and allow their opinions in other doctrines consonant to your Church, when as (by your Tenet) he that ceaseth to beleeve one point, ceaseth to beleeve any one as he should? If you should forsake all Authors that forsake your doctrine in part (or in some particular points) you will generally suffer a <hi>Recoverie</hi> against your owne Church. I will give you but one instance. It is the common Tenet of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church at this day, that the blessed <hi>Virgin</hi> was conceived without originall sinne: yet the contrarie Tenet is likewise maintained by the members of your owne Church. <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> tells us, that <hi>two orders of Friers,</hi>

                           <hi>both fierce, and both led with undaunted Generals, set this question a foote; the</hi> Dominicans <hi>by</hi> Thomas Aquinas, <hi>and the</hi> Franciscans <hi>by</hi> Duns Seotus: <hi>the Councell of</hi> Basill <hi>decreed, that shee was wholly pure without all touch of sinne, but the</hi> Dominicans <hi>obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that it was no lawfull Councell, and the</hi> Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites <hi>of the other side avowed that it was true and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and called the</hi> Dominicans <hi>Heretikes for stande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the power of the Church; so that the matter had come to a shrewd passe, but that Pope</hi> Sixtus <hi>forbad
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:177104:99"/> this Theame to be any more disputed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To proceed to the rest of your observations. I produced for a witnesse <hi>Paulus Vergerius,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Poperie, being a <hi>Romish</hi> Bishop, by the testimonies of <hi>Sleidan,</hi> and <hi>Osiander;</hi> I cited the Councell of <hi>Basil,</hi> for dispensing with the cup to the Lay people; <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> for Mariage of Priests; Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> against your private <hi>Masse;</hi> Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saubon</hi> for your translating of the Scriptures; Lord <hi>Cooke</hi> for the Papists frequenting our <hi>Churches,</hi> till the 11<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. of Qu. <hi>Elisabeth:</hi> Now let the Reader judge of your moderate and learned confutation: First,<note place="margin">

                           <hi>Sleidan</hi> and <hi>Osiander</hi> (say you) <hi>are notorious fellowes both for lying and heresie;</hi> Paulus Verge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, <hi>when he dyed, cast forth a horrible stench, and roared most fearefully like an Oxe; The Councell of</hi> Basile <hi>(you know) is of little or no authoritie with Catholikes, as being reproved by the Sea Apostolicke;</hi> Aeneas Sylvius, <hi>what hee wrote in the time of that Councell, is revoked by him in his Bull of Retractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> Touching <hi>Casaubon,</hi> you say <hi>there is shame enough in store for us both;</hi> Touching the Lord <hi>Cooke, he was soundly answered by a Catholicke Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and so exposed to the scorne of the world for his notorious falshoods.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These be your severall answers, and this is a confutation of their authorities: but I say to you, if these men have spoken untruth, beare witnesse of their falshood, if otherwise they delivered the truth, why do you reproach them?

                           <hi>that by no meanes he can containe, the Priest doth not much offend in giving him this counsell, that he should marry privately, and closely blinde the eyes of the Bishop.

                        <p>It is to be wondered what art and policie your Church doth use to put off the triall of her cause, when it should come to hearing. If we speake of a depravation of your Faith, you crie out it is blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie; If we shew your owne mens complaints for a reformation of your doctrine, you say they meant a reformation onely of Discipline; If we plainly prove the noveltie of your <hi>Trent</hi> Articles, by comparing them with the Tenets of ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, you threaten to bring an <hi>action</hi> of the <hi>Case</hi> against us for slandering and defaming of your Church, except we can assigne the precise time and person when those errors came in.

                        <p>You cannot denie that there are many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar errors in the Church, whose first Authors can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be named by you nor us, and therefore will you conclude they are no errors? The custome of communicating little children in the Sacrament of the Lords bodie and bloud was an error, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued long in the ancient Church, yet the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it was not knowne.

Touching <hi>Scotus,</hi> you neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him, nor answer him: he tells you plainly, that <hi>Transubstantiation was not received for a point of Faith till the Councell of</hi> Lateran, above 1200. yeares after Christ; but of this passage <hi>Ne gry qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem:</hi> And yet you might have answered with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> this opinion of his is no way to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; or with <hi>Gregorie de Valentia,</hi> for this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ought to be corrected. As touching <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Cassander,</hi> you will not vouchsafe them an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, but reject them <hi>inter damnatos authores,</hi> as men to be cast out of your Synagogue. Lastly, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Gregorie de Valentia,</hi> you say <hi>his authoritie doth make against the Knight, why else should he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and mangle it?</hi> But whether I or you have corrupted it, let the Reader judge; my words were these, <hi>The Communion in one kind, when it got first footing in the Church, minimè constat, it doth not
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:177104:113"/> appeare</hi> (saith <hi>Greg. de Valentia:</hi>) You to prove my corruption, cite the words in this manner; <hi>When that custome began in some Churches, it appeareth not; but that there hath been some use of one kind ever from the beginning, I shewed before;</hi> so <hi>Valentia;</hi> and thus you.</p>
                        <p>But in truth, this is none of <hi>Valentia's</hi> own period, but one of your owne making, who cunningly joyne the latter words which follow in <hi>Valentia,</hi> 4. or 5. lines after, to the former, with a <hi>But,</hi> which is none of <hi>Valentia's;</hi> &amp; the former part of the period is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably mangled by you: For thus it stands, <hi>When that custome began in some Churches,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Augustana Confessio.</note>
                           <hi>it appeares not, as is acknowledged by the</hi> Augustane <hi>Confession.</hi> Now in that Confession, the words are these, <hi>The custome of both kindes remained long in the Church, neither doth it appeare when, or by what Author it was changed;</hi> so that he plainly speaketh of the Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, &amp; sheweth the corruption here pretended by M. <hi>Floyd</hi> to be but a cavill, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Valentia</hi> saith this, not of the Church in generall, but of some particular Churches. Thus either you blot &amp; prohibit all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that make for us, although they be members of your own Church, or else you vouchsafe them no answer, or else you quarrell without any just occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offred; and this wil prove an easie way for the weakest scholar in your Church to answer all that can be produced against your faith and doctrine.</p>
                        <p>Now as the Reader hath heard your answer in the generall, so let him see your exceptions to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: For whereas I said with St. <hi>Paul, Forbidding of marriage is a doctrine of Devils,</hi> you answer as if you were angrie with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>he hath been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:177104:113"/> more often than the Knight hath fingers and toes;</hi> and it seems, for that reason you will vouchsafe him no answer at all. This puts me in minde of the saying of <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> a member of your owne Church, who assures us, <hi>If St.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Lud. Vives de Civ. Dei. l. <hi>13.</hi> c. <hi>24.</hi>
                           </note> Paul <hi>were living in these dayes, he would be held either a mad man, or an heretike.</hi> And since you will not resolve me of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning in that place, I will appeale to St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> an Abbot who was restrained from marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by the law of your Church; who speaking of that restraint, gives us the true sense and exposition of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in these words: <hi>All heresies have an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike for their founder; the</hi> Maniches <hi>had</hi> Manes,<note place="margin">Bernard. in Cant.

Surely it is not of man, or by man, and far be it from the spirit of God, but it is foretold (by the Apostle St.</hi> Paul) <hi>to be the fraud &amp; doctrine of devils.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But marriage</hi> (say you) <hi>is not a thing evil in it selfe, but because it lesse agreeth with the holinesse which is required for the exercise of Priestly function.</hi> I pray then what thinke you of a concubine? Doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie with her better agree for exercise of your fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than with a wife? Sure I am, this is the doctrine of your Church: nay more, your Pope <hi>Siricius</hi> would inferre by authoritie of Scripture, that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is unholy in it selfe, for he cites the Text for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <note place="margin">Qui in carne sunt Deo place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re non possunt.</note> Now I pray you what difference is there betwixt the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent heretikes, and the members of your Church? The <hi>Montanists,</hi> the <hi>Tatiani,</hi> the <hi>Eucratitae,</hi> did not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:177104:114"/> prohibite marriage to all, no more than you doe, but onely to their <hi>perfecti,</hi> as being a disparagement to their perfect estate; or as you interpret, <hi>not agreeing to the holines of Priesthood.</hi> Again, whereas I proved out of <hi>Polydore,</hi> that the marriage of Priests was not altogether forbidden till the time of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. that is to say, above a thousand yeares after Christ; you answer, that which <hi>Polydore</hi> cites is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently false, as appeareth particularly by a Canon of the first Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the second Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Now if <hi>Polydore</hi> were mistaken, it concernes not me, for I cited him truly, and he is a member of your Church; but the truth is, you are much mistaken touching those two Councels. For the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> (saith <hi>Sozomen) commended</hi> Paphnutius <hi>judgement,</hi>

                           <hi>and touching this matter of mariage, made to decree an all, but left it to each mans owne will, without any force of necessity;</hi> And the Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> forbiddeth not marriage in Priests, but commandeth abstinence from marriage rites for a certaine time, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>that they may more freely give themselves to prayer, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of their sacred function.</hi> Which plainly shewes, that both Priests were married in those dayes, and consequently, that those two Councels make flatly against you. But <hi>Marius</hi> (say you) <hi>cannot find the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this prohibition;</hi> Polydore <hi>findeth it, and yet both make for the Knights purpose.</hi> And without doubt they doe, for they contradict not one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Polydore</hi> speaketh of publike, absolute, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prohibition; <hi>Marius</hi> of the first condemning it in any Priest; and these confessions may well stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

                        <hi>as it shall be proved of our owne Country of</hi> England.

M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Harding</hi> (who wrote these (67.) yeares since) as appeares by Bishop <hi>Iuels</hi> Epistle, tells us it came in (900.) yeares past: compute <hi>Wolphius</hi> (666.) with M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Hardings</hi> time of (967.) and you shall finde that they agree about one and the same time, and therefore it was neither absurd, nor false, which <hi>Wolphius</hi> uttered.</p>
                     <p>Neither doe you disprove the reason of <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phius,</hi> but you make a <hi>quaere</hi> upon his assertion; <hi>During his</hi> (600.) <hi>and odd yeares) what other Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies were there in the Latin Church, but Latin?</hi> And I may aswell say, what were there in the <hi>Greeke Church</hi> but <hi>Greeke?</hi> But this demand ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth against your Service in an unknowne tongue, not against <hi>Wolphius,</hi> who affirmeth not that the Latin Service was not in the Latin Church before the yeare (666.) but that the Pope obtruded it

                     <p>It is true, this particular Instance is cited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Tables of <hi>Theodoret;</hi> but yet you have affinitie with their Tenets, as neere as cosen Germans once removed. For as you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but one Christ in the heavens, and in the Host, no more did those Heretikes in words; for they rehearsed the Apostles Creed, <hi>Et in Iesum Christum,</hi> and not <hi>in Christos:</hi> and as they made a two-fold Christ, one in heaven, another in earth; so likewise you teach, that Christ in the Sacrament (here on earth) is invisible and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, but in heaven at the same time visible, and with dimensions of quantitie, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Organs. And what is this, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to make two Christs, or at least, to make contradictories true at the same time, of one and the same Christ, in respect of his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be visible and invisible?</p>
                     <p>Touching <hi>Marcus</hi> the Heretike, (you say) <hi>Hee changed the colour; but you teach, that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and accidents remaine, and the substance is changed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true; and your opinion in this, is more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd than that of <hi>Marcus:</hi> for he changed the Colour, to make the people beleeve it was true blood; and you make them beleeve it is blood, when there is neither tast, nor colour of blood.</p>

                     <p>Lastly, touching the <hi>Capernaites;</hi> you deny there is any likenesse of Doctrine. <hi>For</hi> (say you) <hi>the Capernaites thought they should eate Christs body piece-meale, but wee receive Christ whole and entire, not in the forme and shape of flesh, but of bread, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I pray, which of the Evangelists ever charged them with any such conceit? The truth is, they understood the words of Christ as you doe, in a grosse and carnall manner: and therfore Christ in reproving them, saith not, Flesh eaten piece-meale, profiteth nothing; but absolutely, <hi>The flesh profiteth nothing.</hi> As touching your eating of Christ, <hi>whole and intire;</hi> it is all one with their eating of him by piece-meale: for there may be many differences in eating, but all eating the flesh of Christ with teeth and jawes, is <hi>Caperniticall.</hi> But you neither see, nor taste the flesh of Christ, which they dream'd they should; for you receive it, <hi>Not</hi> (say you) <hi>in the forme of flesh, but of bread.</hi> I will returne you an Answer from a learned Divine on our side:<note place="margin">B. <hi>Bilson,</hi> in the difference between Christ subject, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. <hi>pag. 748.</hi>

                        <hi>You chaw the flesh of Christ actually with your teeth, and swallow the same downe your throats, and these be proper actions, and right instruments of externall and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perniticall eating; your eyes and your taste be not; else blind men, and such as by reason of Sicknesse can taste nothing, by your Divinitie can eate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Since then you concurre with the Capernaites (in eating and swallowing) notwithstanding you vary from them in sight and taste, yet your opinion
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:177104:119"/> establisheth a corporall eating of Christs flesh, and a perverting of the meaning of Christs words, no lesse than theirs did.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let mee paralell them together with the most favorable construction I can, yet your Church must have her Antiquitie and descent from those <hi>Capernaites.</hi> For, suppose the <hi>Capernaites</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that Christ would kill himselfe, and give his body to be eaten; yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, that Christ did eate his owne flesh, a thing no lesse barbarous (being meant litterally) than to kill himselfe. Admit the <hi>Capernaites</hi> did beleeve that Christ would give his flesh to be mangled by pieces, or by halves; yet your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches opinion is no lesse cruell, to beleeve that in the Sacrament, Christs flesh is swallowed up whole at one morsell. Lastly, let it be granted that the <hi>Capernaites</hi> did believe, that Christs flesh should be eaten when hee was dead; yet the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Romanists</hi> is more brutish, to imagine his flesh to be eaten when he was alive (being a higher degree of crueltie to devoure men alive,<note place="margin">Apertissimi lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quimur, corpus Christi veri à nobis att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And is it in your Churches power to alter,<note place="margin">Bulla Pij <hi>(4)</hi> Act. <hi>6.</hi> &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Trid Sess. <hi>13</hi>
                        </note> and dispense with Articles of Faith at her pleasure? Surely this Confession proves, that your Church can create new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Beleefe, which elsewhere you deny; or else this is no Article of Faith, being contrary to the practise of the first and best ages; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, your infallible Pope and Councell, are guilty of Error and Sacrilege in a high degree.</p>
                     <p>For a conclusiō of this point, you say the words, <hi>Drinke yee all of this,</hi> (from whence we draw our succession in Doctrine) were spoken to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and in them to Priests, not to the Laitie.</p>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:177104:127"/>
                     <p>By this reason who seeth not, but you may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well take the bread from the Lay people as the cup, for that also was given onely to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles? but if the cup were proper for the Priests onely, why doe you deny it to your <hi>Non confici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Priests? doe they stand in the place of Lay people? Nay more, were not all <hi>Non conficients</hi> at the time of Christs Institution? what strange shifts and evasions hath your Church, to uphold the Novelty of your faith? I will give you but one testimony of Antiquity: <hi>There is</hi> (saith S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Chrysostome) where the Priests differ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the people,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chrys. <hi>18.</hi> in <hi>2.</hi> Corinth.</note>
                        <hi>as when we must receive the dreadfull mysteries; for it is not here, as it was in the old Law, where the Priest eates one part, and the people another, neither was it lawfull for the people to be partaker of those things of which the Priest was; but now it is not so, but rather one body is proposed to all, and one cup (to all.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To passe by innumerable authorities of the Ancients, which you know are full in our behalfe, I will shut up this haereticall point of doctrine (for such is the foundation of it) with a testimony of your owne side. <hi>There are some false Catholikes that feare not to stop the Reformation of the Church,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gerard. Lori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius de Missa publica prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda. p. mihi.</note>
                        <hi>what they can▪ these spare no blasphemy, lest that other part of the Sacrament should be restored to the Lay people: for</hi> (say they) <hi>Christ spake, drinke yee all of this, onely to the Apostles, but the words of the Masse be these, Take and eate yee all of this: Here I would know of them whether this were spoken
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:177104:127"/> onely to the Apostles: then must lay men abstaine likewise from the Element of bread, which to say, is an haeresie, yea, a pestilent and detestable blasphemy. It is therefore consequent that both these words (Eate yee, Drinke yee) were spoken to the whole Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus your Ancient Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> termed your halfe Communion a Sacriledge, and this latter Author of your owne, termes it an haeresie, and a pestilent Blasphemy; and this may serve to prove your descent from the Haeretikes the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees</hi> in this point.</p>
                     <p>From your halfe Communion, you proceede to your <hi>Invocation of Angels,</hi> which I derived from the Haeretikes <hi>Angelici;</hi> and for answer to them, you say, <hi>they were Haeretikes swarving from the rule of the Catholike faith by excesse, that is, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angels more then their due.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is your very case, for you doe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour them, but religiously worship them, and call upon them.

                     <p>Now I appeale to your selfe, and to all your fellow-Jesuites, whether your <hi>Hyperdulia</hi> to the blessed Virgin be not transcendent, or (to use your owne words) <hi>doth not exceed the measure of honour due unto our Lady?</hi> And consequently, whether in this particular, upon your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, you are not descended from the <hi>Collyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Heretikes, your first parents?</p>
                     <p>This is so apparently true, that you know no way to free your selves from the guilt of Heresie, but by waving the question, telling us, <hi>The line should be drawne along by a continued succession, from the beginning to the end:</hi> whereas I told you at first, I did not undertake to prove that those Heretikes, or your Church, had a perpetuall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in person and doctrine; but to shew, <hi>How neere affinity you have with their adulterate issue.</hi> (For those were my very words;) and thereupon I concluded, that you had no succession in person and doctrine: but let us heare your answer? <hi>This is so false, and so apparently false, as that it is not to be doubted, but hee that shall averre it, will make no scruple of any lie, how lewd soever.</hi> Thus you.</p>
                     <p>Good words, and found proofes would better become men of your profession. If you affirme
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:177104:132"/> that you have a Lineall Succession, the proofe lyes on your side: and when I shall see it as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, as spoken, I shall readily confesse my error, till then, let me tell you, it is not your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of Popes, which you say are sold, and printed at <hi>London,</hi> that can make a firme agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of succession in Faith. For by that reason, our Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of blessed memorie, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Queene <hi>Mary</hi> in Faith; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our Faith must be good by your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. By that reason, <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Manasses,</hi> that shut up the doore of the Temple, succeeded <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in the Faith. By that reason, Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> the Arrian, succeeded <hi>Iulius</hi> a Catholike Bishop, in the Faith. By that reason, your Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> succeeded Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> our Protestant <hi>Martyr,</hi> in the Faith. This <hi>(most firme Argument)</hi> therefore (as you call it) is but weake and infirme; and accordingly it was resolved by Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> and the ancient Fathers,<note place="margin">Ambr. de Poenit. cap.</note>
                        <hi>They have not the succession of</hi> Peter, <hi>that want the faith of</hi> Peter.</p>
                     <p>In fine, if for no other cause, yet for this alone, your succession in Faith is interrupted, because you your selfe confesse, that some Articles which are received as points of Faith in your Church, are different from those which were received in the Primitive Churches; and therefore want suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in the true doctrine. And that you may yet farther know there was an interruption of the true Faith in succeeding Ages,<note place="margin">Genebr. Chrono. lib. <hi>4.</hi>

                        <p>IN the eighth Section, I assumed to prove the Antiquitie, and Vniversalitie of our Religion, by and with the consenting testimonies of the Romane Church: you tell mee, <hi>It is a bold and unlikely adventure, and it is shamelesse and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent.</hi>

                           </gap>ht there was none so ignorant or impudent, as to denie both the Vniversalitie and Antiquitie of three Creeds; two Sacraments instituted by Christ; the two and twentie books of Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scriptures; of the first foure Generall <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels;</hi> of the Apostolike Traditions; of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Liturgies; of the Ordination of Priests and Deacons. These are our Tenets, and these
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:177104:134"/> were the particular Instances which I made: and to bring Authors for the proofe of these, as if we made a doubt of that which all true Christians did generally receive and beleeve, I say with S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Austin,</hi>

                        <p>To cite many Authors, or to bring none, then is all alike to you; for in your doome, nothing will free mee from the <hi>name, and punishment due to Heresie,</hi> but the authoritie of the Church: and yet in this, you have granted mee more than I could expect; for you have given mee liberty to take my authoritie from the Church, so it be from the <hi>Catholike,</hi> or the <hi>Roman.</hi> And hereby you have made your <hi>Roman</hi> Church distinct from the <hi>Catholike,</hi> which is most true; which, both you your selfe, and most of your fellow Jesuits have made all one, and confirmed by the title of <hi>(Roman Catholike)</hi> in all your writings.</p>
                        <p>This being granted, I proceed to the rest of your exceptions. <hi>In this Section</hi> (say you) <hi>he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth onely three Catholike Authors,</hi> Adrian, Coste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, <hi>and</hi> Harding, <hi>but no word for Antiquitie, or universalitie.</hi> Thus you.</p>

                        <p>Hee that shall reade my Section in <hi>Via tuta,</hi> with this your Answer, must needs confesse that you deale not fairly, nor ingeniously with mee: for sometimes you leape from the beginning of a Chapter to the end, then you returne againe to the beginning, being willing to conceale or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the truth of my Assertions. You so mingle my words with your own in the same Character, that a prudent Reader can hardly discerne mine from yours: but most usuall it is with you to cry down my words with bitter passages, and decline the question in all. As for Instance, in this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whereas I said, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth confesse the Antiquitie, and Vniversalitie of our Religion long before <hi>Luther,</hi> I instanced in our three <hi>Creeds,</hi> and the rest before named. One while you cry out of my impudencie, that I cite no Authors; another while, that if I did cite them, they would not serve my turne: but you never mention either the <hi>Creeds,</hi> or <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or <hi>Councels,</hi> or any of the points which you well knew had Antiquitie, and Vniversalitie in the name and opinion of all Christians. After that, you flie to the later end of my Section, and there you tell mee, I cite but three Authors, and yet none prove the Antiquitie or Vniversalitie of our Faith. Then you goe backe againe, and you tell the Reader, <hi>I say nothing here of the mans notable cunning and falshood, in making him beleeve, as if we did excuse our selves in those things whereof they accuse us.</hi>

                        <p>If such extravagant excursions and reproches you call a Reply, or a Catholike Answer, I will lay my finger on my mouth, and say with your <hi>Cardinall, Qui decipi vult, decipiatur.</hi>

                        <p>Briefely, the substance of my Assertion was this: The three <hi>Creeds,</hi> the Canonicall <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the Apostolike <hi>Traditions,</hi> the foure first generall <hi>Councels,</hi> and the rest were so generally received in the bosome of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that for that reas n i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Next I shewed that the positive Doctrines of our Church (mentioned in our (39.) Articles) were contained in a very few points, and those al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so had Antiquity and Vniversality; then I shewed that those doctrines which they obtruded upon us, were but Additions and Negative Tenets in our Articles, and that many of those additions were condemned, or at least excused, by their owne men: And I instanced in three Authors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, for three severall points of their Doctrine; and this is the substance and true meaning of that Section; and thus much by way of advertisement to the mod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:177104:135"/> excuse your adoration, by implying a condition? and is it not all one according to your doctrine? For if it be rightly consecrated, it is Christ, if not, it is a Crust, and no man amongst your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants knoweth what it is, because he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Priests intention. Take it therefore which way you will, yet my assertion stands true; we condemne you for adoring the Elements, for ought you know, of bread and wine, because it doth depend upon the intention of the Priest, whether Christ be there or no; but yet you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not condemne us for adoring Christs rent body in the Heavens: and however the Priests doe consecrate, yet (saith <hi>Gerson) when the host is ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>

This I told you before, and (blessed be God) you have not wherewith to charge us in your Reply. But
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:177104:140"/> you say, <hi>It is far greater evill for you to be truly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Heresie, than for us to be charged with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie:</hi> yet neither you, nor all your fellow-Jesuits could ever prove us guilty of either. But what may wee thinke of your Church, which is justly charged, and highly guilty of both? Your Popes (which the Jesuits resolve to be the Church) are condemned for Heretikes by your Councels, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Heretikes by the Popes themselves, and condemned of Heresie by your best learned Divines. Your worship of Images and Saints, concludes in flat Idolatrie; and in particular (by the Doctrine of your owne Church) the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacramentall Bread and Cup, (for want of a right intention) becomes an Idoll in the Temple. These things I have in part proved, which in place convenient, shall be more fully handled hereafter.</p>

You are so farre from shewing it, that you cunningly suppressed these words, and not so much as mentioned them: and thus, one while suppressing the point in question;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:177104:140"/> other whiles, by declining the true state of the question, you shew your wit is better than your cause, and declare your Sophistrie to be better than your Divinitie.</p>

                           <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is of longer continuance; for some say it hath continued from the time of</hi> Sylvester, <hi>(which is three hundred yeares after Christ) others say, from the time of the Apostles. Secondly, because it is more Vniversall, for there is scarse any Country, wherein this Sect hath not crept. Thirdly, whereas all other sorts blaspheme God, this Sect hath a great shew of godlinesse: for they live justly before men, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve all rightly concerning God, and the Articles of the Creed; onely they speake evill of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and hate it; and by this meanes draw mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes

                        <p>For a conclusion of this Section; you say, that the three Creeds, the two Sacraments, the foure Generall Councels, the two and twenty books of Canonicall Scripture, <hi>We had them from you.</hi> Let it be your comfort then, that you had something in your Church which was worth the gleaning, after the devill had sowed the Tares amongst the good Corne. But I would not have you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much confident of that neither; for originally wee had them from the Church Catholike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was a <hi>Roman.</hi> For, the Gospell was preached in <hi>England</hi> before it was in <hi>Rome;</hi> and we had in <hi>England,</hi> a Christian Church and King, before <hi>Rome</hi> had a Christian <hi>Emperor,</hi> yea long before Poperie, or the name of <hi>Pope</hi> was heard of in the Christian world; (in the sense you now take it.) And in after Ages, when the Gospell of Christ was rooted out by Heathen persecutors (where it was first planted) it was afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by Preachers, partly sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> partly by the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church, but by neither was the Faith preached and restored; which your present Church now teacheth, and maintaineth at this day.</p>
                        <pb n="279" facs="tcp:177104:146"/>
                        <p>And lastly, if wee had the three Creeds, the two Sacraments, the 22. bookes of Canonicall Scripture, and the first foure Generall Councels from you, then you cannot deny that we teach the Ancient Faith, first given to the Saints; and that we had a Church visible long before <hi>Luthers</hi> dayes, (for those <hi>Tenents</hi> were sufficient of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to make a glorious, and a visible Church in the first and best ages) they were received by succeeding Christians in all the later Ages, and are now become the Positive, and Affirmative Articles of our Beleefe, which for the greater part, were ever taught and received in the bosom of your owne Church. To shut up all your bitter Aspersions, of Corrupting, of Falsifying, of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of Lynding, and I know not what reproches, cast upon me in these first (8) Sections; I will shut up all, I say, which hitherto hath beene delivered by you, with that answer of <hi>Socrates</hi> to his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, before the Judges:<note place="margin">Plato in Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Socratis.</note>
                           <hi>My Lords</hi> (saith hee) <hi>in what sort your affections have been stirred with mine accusers eloquence which you heard them speake, I cannot tell. But well I wot, for mine owne part, I my selfe, whom it toucheth most, was almost perswaded to beleeve, that what they said was true, yea although it were against my selfe; so handsomly they can tell their tale, and so likely, and so smoothly they convey their maters: every word they spake, had appearance of Truth, and yet in good sooth, they have scarsely uttered one word of Truth.</hi>

The like accident hath befallen our <hi>Locrus,</hi> or rather <hi>Lynus;</hi> who, as hee was warbling an exquisite <hi>Lesson,</hi> lately <hi>prick'd</hi> by him, brake not his <hi>Harpes,</hi> but his <hi>Hearts string:</hi> and J like the Grass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper, with my harsh sounding voice, must now supply that defect, and perfect the tune. The prime Doctor of the Schooles, <hi>Aquinas,</hi> was wont to say, that hee desired but to live so long, till hee might see the golden-mouthed
<pb facs="tcp:177104:149"/> Father, Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> his imperfect worke upon <hi>Matthew</hi> finished. And J doubt not, but that many, who very much affected Sir <hi>Humphrey Lynde</hi> his person, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, heartily wish, that this his <hi>Cygnea cantio,</hi> and last worke against the common Adversarie, might be perfected. Which task, partly out of my respect to the worthy deceased Knight, partly at the request of some friends yet alive, I have undertaken; promising to adde (according to the distinction of the Schooles) <hi>perfectionem partium</hi> thereunto, but not <hi>graduum,</hi> a perfection of Parts, but not Degrees: that is, an Answer to all the parts and Chapters remaining, but not with the like multiplicitie of reading, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratnesse of style, as may be observed in the Knights writings. For, J <hi>owne</hi> not this Worke as mine, nor intend to shape any new weapon against the Adversaries of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, upon his <hi>Anvile,</hi> but onely <hi>Hammer</hi> that <hi>Iron</hi> which hee tooke <hi>red hot out of the fire.</hi> In which regard, I entitle my Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adversions upon <hi>Flood</hi> his reply, <hi>Stricturas;</hi> partly, because like sparkles, they give some,
<pb facs="tcp:177104:149"/> though small light into the points in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie: partly, because they burne whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they light. Some peradventure, would have wished a more moderate Answer; but in reason they could expect no other from him, whom, not zeale onely, of the truth of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion scandalously traduced, but love to a departed friend, and just anger and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at an Adversarie, trampling upon his ashes, heat in the penning hereof, above his ordinarie temper. Were <hi>Romish</hi> Priests and Jesuits ingenuous Adversaries, in whom there were any hope to gaine by mildnesse, and win by yeelding unto them as much as might be, without prejudice to the Truth; I should then perswade all that write against them, to temper their Inke, rather with Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water than Ʋinegar.<note place="margin">Vrtica si mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liùs tractetur vrit.</note> But in all my conflicts with them, at home and abroad, I find them like Nettles, <hi>which sting if they be gently touched, but hurt not at all if they be roughly handled.</hi>

For let it be granted according to the doctrine of <hi>Aelfrick</hi> and <hi>Bertram,</hi> that Christ so turned the Bread into his Body at his last supper, as hee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Manna and water into his owne flesh in the wildernesse, what will hereupon insue? but that the conversion or change which is made in the elements is not reall, and corporall, but spirituall and sacramentall, as that was in the Desert: of which the Apostle speaketh, <hi>the</hi>
                           <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.4.</note>
                           <hi>spirituall rock followed them, and that rock was Christ.</hi> When Manna fell, and the rock was strucken, Christ was not incarnate, nor many hundred yeares after: how then could the Manna, or the water bee real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly turned into his flesh and bloud? Moreover, howsoever hee eludeth the former words of <hi>Aelfrick; There is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the body wherein Christ suffered, and the body which is received of the faithfull, the body in which Christ suffered, was borne of the flesh of</hi> Mary, <hi>and consisted of bloud and bone, but the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:177104:159"/> other is gathered of many cornes without bloud and bone,</hi> (by saying) <hi>that the difference which Aelfrick sheweth betweene Christ on the Crosse and Christ on the Sacrament is in his manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not in the being it selfe, not denying him to bee really in both:</hi> yet the later words which containe an inference upon the former: <hi>therefore there is nothing to bee understood in the Sacrament bodily, but spiritually:</hi> admit of no colourable evasion, for if <hi>nothing bee there understood bodily but spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually;</hi> then must needs the words, <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> be understood figuratively, then must we not according to the doctrine of those times under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any substantiall change of the bread into Christs very body, or the Wine into his bloud really and corporally.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> To the third. The difference betweene Papists of most eminent note concerning the words, by vertue whereof they teach Transubstantiation is effected, maketh much against the doctrine it selfe, and by consequence quite overthroweth it. For thus we argue against them out of this their difference: If the bread bee turned into Christs body, then either by the words of benediction before hee brake the bread, or gave it, &amp;c. or by the very words of Consecration, <hi>viz. hoc est corpus meum.</hi> But hee neither changed the bread into his Body by the one, nor by the other; <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee changed it not at all. Not by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent benediction, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> prove. For till the last instant of the prolation of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:177104:159"/> the words <hi>This is my Body,</hi> the substance of bread remaineth. Not by the words of Consecration: for as <hi>Durand</hi> and <hi>Odo Cameracensis,</hi> and <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Caesarea</hi> prove, Christ could not have said after hee had blessed the Bread, <hi>This is my body, unlesse by blessing it he had made it his body before.</hi> If when Christ said <hi>Take yee and eate,</hi> yet at that time the Bread by bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction were not changed, it would follow that Christ did command his Disciples to take, and eate the substance of Bread, which to say is to deny the article of Transubstantiation. Neither can the Iesuite heale this sore by his <hi>vertuall salve,</hi> in saying, <hi>that those men above alledged, who impugne the present tenent of the Schooles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the words of Consecration, in which the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Sacrament consisteth vertually retracted such opinions, because they submitted their writings to the censure of the Catholique Church:</hi> for so wee may say with better reason, that what they held against us, <hi>they vertually retracted by submitting their judgement to the Catholique Church,</hi> which we can easily prove not to bee the particular Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but the Universall, which in all times, and all places through the Christian world hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the <hi>common faith once given to the Saints</hi> without any of those later Articles which <hi>P.

The precept of the Apostle, <hi>bee ye followers of mee as I am of Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 11.1. is generall, and reacheth as well to acts of pietie, as charitie. As <hi>non est distinguendum ubi lex non distinguit,</hi> so <hi>non est restringendum ubi lex non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringit;</hi> as wee may not distinguish where the law doth not distinguish: so we must not restraine where the law hath no restriction. The <hi>Iesuite</hi> himselfe saith, that S. <hi>Pauls</hi> imitation is <hi>directed to all,</hi> if to all, then to Priests; and againe hee saith, <hi>these words come in very fitly to prove that in all things that appertaine unto salvation wee should
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:177104:173"/> seeke to imitate S.</hi> Paul <hi>as hee doth Christ.</hi> And I hope the <hi>Iesuit</hi> holdeth the worthy receiving of the Sacrament a matter of salvation. I am sure the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Hee that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himselfe.</hi> But what need wee dispute this point any further? sith the Apostle after hee had delivered this precept in the beginning of the chapter, in pursuit thereof at the 23 verse instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the Sacrament it selfe, saying, <hi>What I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord, that I delivered unto you, that the Lord Iesus the same night hee was betrayed tooke bread &amp;c.</hi> Surely if wee are to follow the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in the performance of morall duties, much more of religious, and this the <hi>Iesuit</hi> in the end is compelled to grant, and therefore addeth for his further answer, that <hi>Catholique Priests doe imitate S.</hi> Paul <hi>in the administration of the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are ready to communicate with all such as come worthily to receive.</hi> Catholique Priests, that is in his language Romanists imitate S. <hi>Paul</hi> in their Masse; wherein? and how? he administred a Sacrament, they offer a sacrifice: hee prayed in a knowne tongue, they in the Latine unknowne to the people: he acknowledgeth no Lords supper where there is not a Communion,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.17.</note> whereby <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are made one bread and one body, because they all partake of that one bread;</hi> they say private Masses in which the Priest bids the people eate, and drinke, but eateth and drinketh all himselfe: hee speaketh of <hi>breaking of bread,</hi> they breake none
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:177104:174"/> at all: hee commandeth <hi>every one to examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and so to eate of that bread, and drinke of that cup, ver.</hi> 28. They forbid the Laytie to touch the cup: and call they this an imitation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle? is it not rather an immutation and violation of the Apostles holy precepts and practise? in these things they tread in the Apostles steps, as the Antipodes doe in ours, who are therefore so stiled, because their feet and steps are diametrally opposite to ours. Yea but saith <hi>Flood, there are many things which S.</hi> Paul <hi>did,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">P. 194.</note>
                           <hi>and wherein he did desire to bee followed, as chastening of his body, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and prayer, in which Protestants are not so well able to prove themselves followers of him, as Papists can doe.</hi> I answer, that although S. <hi>Paul</hi> in this place speaketh of no such thing, neither can his words reasonably bee stretched to the chastening and beating downe of his body to bring it in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, because hee addeth, <hi>as I am of Christ bee ye followers of mee as I am of Christ.</hi> Now wee reade not that Christ beate his owne body, or needed to endeavour to bring it into subjection, which was alwayes so from the beginning: yet let him rightly understand the Apostles practise in taming his flesh, and subduing his body, and he will find Protestants as ready to follow him as any the most austere Papist. For by taming his body hee meaneth not whipping or scourging, which Papists receive by tradition from the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques called <hi>flagellantes</hi> or the whippers: nor was his fasting an abstinence from flesh and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                        <p>To the third. That the precept of S. <hi>Paul, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> tary one for another when they came to eate,</hi> apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the Sacrament is evident, first by that hee calleth it the <hi>Lords supper</hi> which they came together to eate,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.20.</note>
                           <hi>when yee come together in one place, this is not to eate the Lords Supper.</hi> Now that by the Lords Supper, not the Agape which were not instituted by him, but the Sacrament is meant not only S. <hi>Austin</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>

The neglect of the former dutie in not staying for their guests at their <hi>Agapae,</hi> could bee at the most but a discourtesie or incivilitie; but the neglect in the later, as the Apostle teacheth, trenched upon their conscience, and hazarded their salvation, wherefore my brethren, saith the Apostle, <hi>v.</hi> 33.34. <hi>When you come together to eate tarie one for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and if any man hunger, let him eate at home that you come not together to condemnation.</hi>

Moreover, as the worthy parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Sacrament wonderfully confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: so it was instituted by Christ to represent the union of the Priest with the people, which cannot bee done in private Masses wherein the Priest communicateth alone.

Yea but (saith the <hi>Iesuit) if this argument of the</hi> Knight <hi>were good, it would follow that not only some, but all the people must receive together with the Priest, and that the people must not receive one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> I answer, that it followeth indeed that all the people that are solemnly invited by the Priest, and come prepared, ought to receive together; and this the Apostles words strongly enforce, <hi>wee being many are one bread and one body,</hi>

I answer, that the publike and solemne time at which all were bound to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in the Easterne Church, was but once a yeare, to wit at Easter: yet did the people in those
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:177104:178"/> dayes both at other times, and especially when they lay on their death-bed, receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: which was therefore called <hi>Viaticum morientium.</hi> As for S. <hi>Chrysostome;</hi> 'tis true that he <hi>much complaineth of the backwardnesse of the people in comming to the Communion, and professeth for his owne part, that hee neglected not his dutie to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the holy Sacrament, though hee were much discouraged therein by the paucitie and raritie of those, who presented themselves at the Lords Table:</hi> yet I find not that he any where saith, that he cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the Communion when there was none to participate with him. For though it may bee at sometime especially on the weeke dayes, none of the people did communicate with him: yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes some of the Clergie, who assisted that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on communicated with him; and therefore the <hi>Iesuits</hi> inference, <hi>that by our doctrine the Priest must not say Masse once in seven yeares, unlesse the people bee so devout as to receive with him,</hi> is most absurd. For in all Colledges, and Cathedrall Churches, the Priests and Deacons communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate every moneth at the least, though none of the people sometimes receive with them. But in parish Churches it were a prophanation and a meere mockerie to administer the Communion without some of the people, to say, <hi>Take, eate, and drinke you all of this,</hi> when there is none to eate or drinke but the Priest himselfe, none, I say, neither Layk nor Clergie man.</p>

                        <p>To the first. The <hi>Iesuit</hi> in this Paragraph <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thinketh that hee discourseth very profoundly, for page 201. he saith, <hi>the</hi> Knight <hi>is not capable of it;</hi> whereas his <hi>chanel</hi> here is so <hi>shallow,</hi> that any child instructed in his Catechisme, may <hi>wade</hi>
                           <pb n="70" facs="tcp:177104:186"/> thorow it. <hi>Without an infallible rule,</hi> saith he, <hi>there can be no certaine beliefe in God.</hi> An extreame ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <hi>without an unerring Pope no certaine rule of faith,</hi> an extreame falsitie: the <hi>Iesuit</hi> cannot see Christ for the Pope, nor the Scripture for the <hi>Trent</hi> Canons. Let him remove them out of the way; and if hee have an eye of faith, hee may clearly see both, and in them an infallible rule of faith, and certaine meanes to learne true beliefe in God. The occasion of this discourse of the <hi>Iesuit</hi> was the <hi>Knight</hi> charging Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> for laying a foundation of Atheisme in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if we should take away the credit of the Roman Church and Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Christian faith it selfe might bee called in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The charge lieth heavie upon the Cardinall. For to disparage the selfe-sufficiencie of the holy Scriptures, and suspend our Christian faith upon the Decrees of a late factious conventicle, reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the greater part of the Christian world, is a ready way to overthrow all Divine faith, and true religion. Yet the <hi>Iesuit</hi> seeketh to cover the nakednesse of the Cardinall with these <hi>fig leaves; If a generall Councell may erre, the Church may erre; if the Church may erre, the faith which that Church teacheth may faile, and consequently there can bee no certaintie.</hi> How easily are these leaves plucked away, and torne in pieces? 1. Though such a Councell as the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of a few Bishops swaied by the Italian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may erre, it would not from thence follow,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:177104:186"/> that the whole representative Church might erre. 2. Though the whole representative Church in a free and generall Councell lawfully called might erre, yet many millions in the Catholique Church may hold the orthodox beliefe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the faith of the Church not totally faile. Yea but saith the <hi>Iesuit, take away the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie of the Church there is no rule of faith.</hi> This assertion of his is open blasphemie, as if God would not bee true, though all men were found liars: though the Roman Church and Pope erre a thousand times, yet the rule of faith remaineth unvariable in the holy Scriptures. Yea but S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> equalizeth the foure first generall Councels to the Gospel, and saith in effect, that they could as little erre as the 4. Gospels, and that upon the deniall of their authoritie the Christian faith might be shaken as well as by the deniall of the Gospels: and the like authoritie giveth your Parliament unto them. I answer, S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualizeth the foure first generall Councels to the foure Gospels, not in respect of authoritie, but in respect of the veritie of the articles defined in them: he saith not, <hi>they could as little erre,</hi> but <hi>they did as little erre,</hi> in their decisions, or to speake more properly that their doctrine was as true as Gospell, because the determinations in those first generall Councels against Heretiques are evidently deduced out of holy Scriptures. Our Parliament alluding to the words of S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> speaketh in the same sense, as hee doth. Yea but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:177104:187"/> saith the <hi>Iesuit,</hi> your Parliament lawes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that for heresie whatsoever is condemned for such in any of those Councels, which is in other words to acknowledge them for a rule of faith, and consequently to bee of infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and to joyne them in the same ranke with the Canonicall Scriptures. <hi>Idem jungat Vulpes;</hi> by the like reason the <hi>Iesuit</hi> might say we joyne the booke of Articles of Religion, and Homilies in the same ranke with the Canonicall Scriptures, because we condemne for heretiques all that obstinatly maintaine any doctrine repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them: which wee doe not, because we hold the Decrees of a provinciall Synod, to bee of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authoritie: but because wee are able to prove all the Articles there established, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to the holy Scriptures. Yea, but further saith the <hi>Iesuit</hi> in the same statute, <hi>you give power to the Court of Parliament,</hi>

In such sort to declare faith, is not to be the rule of faith, but to judge and measure things by the rule. There is a maine difference betweene these two, which yet the <hi>Iesuit</hi> here confoundeth as if they were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident) to declare faith, and to bee the rule of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:177104:187"/> faith every Iudge declareth the Law, yet is he not the rule of the Law. The Inquisitors in their <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices expurgatorij,</hi> and the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> in their censures declare what is heresie: yet they are not I trow the Rule of popish faith, every meater in the market declareth that such or such is the measure of corne and graine▪ yet is not every, or any corne-meater the Winchester standerd. It is one thing to be the rule, and another to measure by the rule, and declare what we have measured. But to retort the <hi>Iesuits</hi> phrase upon himselfe, hee is not <hi>capable</hi> it seemes of this discourse which yet every market-woman or boy is. Well, let the authoritie of generall Councels bee great in the Church, and of the foure first Councels greatest of all, <hi>quid hoc ad Rombum?</hi> what maketh this for the infallibilitie of the <hi>Trent</hi> conventicle? much saith the <hi>Iesuit</hi> every way, for <hi>what,</hi> saith hee, <hi>can you say more against the present Church, and present Councell of Trent, then against the Church and Councels of those times?</hi> What can we say? nay what can we not say? what have we not said? or what could all the Papists in the world answer to what wee have already said? After hee hath taken away the legall exceptions made against this conventicle by the Authour of the historie of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and of the <hi>litterae missivae,</hi> and <hi>Iewel</hi> his Treatise affixed to that Historie, and <hi>Chemnisius</hi> his Examen, and Doctor <hi>Bowles</hi> his latine Sermon preached to the Convocation, and lately printed: after hee hath
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:177104:188"/> proved which hee will never bee able, that the Assemblie at <hi>Trent</hi> was a free and generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and called by lawfull authoritie, and all the proceedings in it according to ancient Canons: yet it will still fall as short of the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> in authoritie, as in antiquitie: that consisted of most eminent, learned, and holy Bishops and Confessors: this for the most part of hungrie ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals depending on the Popes trencher as <hi>Dudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> a Bishop present at that Councell declareth at large in his letter set before the Historie of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> to which I referre the reader.</p>
                        <p>To the second. The testimonies alledged by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the <hi>Knight</hi> for the sufficiencie of holy Scriptures are ponderous, and weightie, and the <hi>Iesuits</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to them are sleight, vaine, and frivolous.

                           <hi>for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the Councell of God,</hi> hee saith that S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of the doctrine by him preached, not of the written word of God: as in like manner our Saviour saith, <hi>that what hee heard from his Father hee made knowne unto them, Iohn</hi> 15.15. and yet delivered not one word in writing. It is true, S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which he preached, but it is as true that the doctrine which he preached hee confirmed unto them by testimonie of Scripture. For S. <hi>Luke</hi> saith <hi>Acts</hi> 17.2. that <hi>S. Paul as his manner was, reasoned with them out of the Scriptures opening
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:177104:188"/> and alledging that Iesus whom hee preached unto them was Christ, and they that received the word with all readinesse of mind searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so: and again I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that after that way which they call heresie,</hi>

For who knoweth not that repentance towards God, and faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Iesus Christ are written almost in every Sermon of the Prophets, and chapter of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists. What hee addeth for confirmation of his answer, (from the example of our Saviour, who made knowne to his Disciples whatsoever hee heard from his Father, and yet delivered not one word in writing) no whit at all helpeth his cause. For albeit we grant that our Saviour wrote nothing (except wee give credit to a relation in <hi>Eusebius</hi> of a letter written by him to King <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garus</hi>) yet hee commanded his Apostles to write those <hi>things which they had heard and seene, what thou seest write it in a booke,</hi>

I answer, Christ might adde as many Seales as hee pleased, but in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament hee hath put but two, neither need wee any more, the first sealeth unto us our new birth, the second our growth in Christ.

If they take Sacrament in a large sense, for every divine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, holy Ordinance, or sacred Rite, they may find as well seventeene as seven Sacraments in the Scriptures: if they take the Word in the strict sense for such a sacred Rite, as is instituted in the New Testament by Christ, with a visible signe or element representing and applying unto us some invisible sanctifying and saving grace; I wish the <hi>Iesuit</hi> might but practise one of their Sacraments, that is, doe <hi>penance</hi> so long till hee found in Scripture that, and the other foure Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments which they have added to the two Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Christ. To begin with them in order, and give <hi>Order</hi> the first place, wee acknowledge the ordination of Priests and Deacons by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to be <hi>de jure divino,</hi> and we beleeve where they are done according to Christs Institution, that grace is ordinarily given to the party ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but not sacramentall grace, not <hi>gratia gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum faciens,</hi> but <hi>gratia gratis data,</hi> a ghostly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer for the good of others, not a necessary grace of the Spirit sanctifying and saving the soule of the ordained. Besides, this Sacrament of order is out of order. For it hath no element added to the sanctified forme of words. Yes that it hath (saith <hi>Flood) the Host, Chalice, and Patent, or Letters of order. The Bread and Wine,</hi> I grant are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments appointed by Christ, but in another sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Eucharist, not in this, and tis confessed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:177104:196"/> on all sides, that as in the Sacraments of the old Law, so of the New, the elements must not bee confounded. Neither doth Christ any where command that in the ordination of Bishops, or Priests, such a Rite or Ceremonie should be used: neither doth the Host or Chalice signifie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the invisible Grace, or Ghostly power then given. And as for the instrument it is a parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but no element; it is a legible writing te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying the party is ordained, but no visible signe of an invisible grace; no Seale of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. For the Patent, Chalice, and Bible, they are not, as before was said, any sacramentall signes of divine grace, but only ensignes and tokens of their severall offices and functions, or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are to bee used in their ministration, besides, every one of these orders is conferred by words and Ceremoniss cleane differing one from another, whereupon it followeth, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther none of them is a Sacrament properly so called, or that each of them apart is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and so the number of Sacraments will bee neere doubled. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> evasion <hi>De Sacram. ordin. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8. to wit, that they are all <hi>unum genere,</hi> and referred to one end will not serve the turne, for so all the other six Sacraments are <hi>unum genere,</hi> and all referred to one end, to wit, to unite the receivers some way to Christ, or derive some grace from Christ to them, and yet they are not one Sacrament, but as they teach, six distinct species.</p>

                        <p>For <hi>Confirmation,</hi> we allow of it as an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall tradition, not as a Sacrament of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. For where doth Christ command that those who have heene baptized, should bee after confirmed by a Bishop? Where is an element or forme of words prescribed by Christ as in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and the Lords Supper? The <hi>Iesuit</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the element in this Sacrament is chrisme, or oyle. But this cannot bee: because in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sacraments there ought to bee divers ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therefore sith Chrisme and oyle is the element in Extreame Unction, which taketh the name from thence, it cannot bee the matter or element in Confirmation. <hi>Accedit verbum ad ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> saith <hi>S.

No
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:177104:197"/> (saith <hi>Flood?) is not the true sorrow of heart decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by humble confession, together with prayer, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, and Almes-deeds, an outward element, or thing to bee perceived by sense?</hi> I answer, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing perceived by sense, is not presently an element in a Sacrament, it must bee as the Schooles out of S. <hi>Austine</hi> define <hi>a visible signe of invisible grace.</hi> Confession and prayer are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed audible, but not visible: Fasting and Almes-deedes are visible, but visible workes of pietie and charitie, not visible elements in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: they are morall duties, not sacramentall Rites. For what correspondencie is betweene these, and absolution or remission of sinnes? how doth Fasting or Almes exhibit to the eye this invisible grace? Contrition of the heart of which hee speaketh, is no visible or sensible signe, Confession is sensible, but not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, nor ordained as the elements are in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to signifie the grace of God, but to aske it: The sacred signes ought to be administred by the Priest, but Confession is made by the penitent. The same may be said of corporall satisfactions which are accomplished by the sinner, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in his house by fastings, or whippings, or abroad by pilgrimages, whereas sacred signes are to bee administred by the hands of the Priest, and ordinarily in the Church; Absolution also cannot bee a sacred signe of the grace of God, seeing that if it bee good and available, it is the grace of God; besides this Absolution, is not an
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:177104:198"/> element, nor a visible signe of an invisible grace, for the words are not seene: if it be said that it is sufficient, that it is significantly the grace of God, by the same reason the preaching of the Word should bee a sacrament, for it is significantly the grace of God. In all Sacraments the Word must bee joyned to the element; but here they will have the Word to bee an element: the imposition of the Priests hands on the penitent is a visible action, but not a visible element, nor is it institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Christ. When the <hi>Trent</hi> Councell, and the Roman Catechisme come to assigne the matter of this Sacrament, they doe it very faintly with a <hi>quasi materia, Sess.</hi> 14. <hi>de poenit. c.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; Catechis.

                        </p>
                        <p>For <hi>Matrimonie,</hi> it is a holy ordinance of God, but more ancient then the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore can be no seale of it: it was instituted by God in Paradise, not by Christ in the Gospell: yea but (saith the <hi>Iesuit</hi>) though it were before a naturall contract, yet might it not be exalted by Christ to the dignitie of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I answer, the <hi>Iesuit</hi> must not dispute what Christ might doe, but what hee did; When hee proveth out of the Evangelists or Apostles, that Christ exalted it to the dignitie of a Sacrament, wee will hold it in that high esteeme, but this hee can never doe: for none of the Evangelists relate that hee altered the Law, or nature of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:177104:198"/> but only that hee confirmed it, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it with his presence, and the first Miracle which hee wrought. Other exaltation wee find not in the Gospell; And as <hi>S.

                        <p>Our second exception against the Sacrament of Matrimonie is, that in it there is no outward element sanctified by the Word of promise. To this the <hi>Iesuit</hi> answereth; the bodies of men and women, are they not as much as an outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Yes surely as much in quantitie and more too:<note place="margin">Bell. l. <hi>1.</hi> de matrim. c. <hi>6.</hi> Si matrimonium consideretur.

Our third exception against the sacrament of Matrimonie is that if it bee a sacrament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring grace, as they teach, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> why doe they deprive Priests of it? and make them take a solemne vow against it? The <hi>Iesuit</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>that though Mariage bee a holy thing, as Order also is, yet as Order is forbidden to all women, so upon good reason Mariage is forbidden all Priests.</hi> Tis true, I grant that all holy things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:177104:199"/> are not fit for all ages, sexes, and callings. In particular it is no way fit that women should be admitted into holy Orders, because they are <hi>forbidden to speake in the Church;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.34</note> and it seemeth to bee against the law of nature, that the weaker and more ignoble sex should be appointed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct and governe the stronger and more noble: but there is not the like reason in Order and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie.<note place="margin">Heb. 13.4.</note> For the Scripture saith, <hi>Mariage is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable among all;</hi> but not that the order of Priesthood is commendable in all men much lesse women.

                        <p>For <hi>Extreame Vnction</hi> the <hi>lagge</hi> of all their Sacraments little or nothing can bee said.

The Apostles indeed used oile, but as a medicine to heale the body, not as a sacrament to cure the soule.

Were the <hi>Dioscuri</hi> which are commonly knowne by the name of <hi>gemini</hi> seven, or two only, to wit, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor</hi> and <hi>Pollax?</hi> As for S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> though they say not <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> that the two Sacraments of the Church issued out of Christs side, as <hi>S. Austine</hi> doth: yet they can bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of no more then two Sacraments: for there were but two things which issued out of our Saviours side, to wit, water and blood, whereby they understand Baptisme and the Lords Supper. Had there issued out of our Saviours side, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with water and blood Chrisme or <hi>balsamum,</hi> or had a rib beene taken from thence, the <hi>Iesuit</hi> might have some colour to draw more Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of it: but now sith the Text saith there issued onely <hi>two things, water and blood;</hi> and the Fathers say the Sacraments of the Church are thereby meant: it is most apparant that by <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta</hi> they meant those two only: which they there name in expresse words, Baptisme and the price of our redemption, that is Christs blood in the Eucharist.</p>
                        <p>To the seventh. The authoritie of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> is as a thorne in the <hi>Iesuits</hi> eye, for it cannot but bee a great prejudice to their cause, that so lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:177104:201"/> a Bishop as S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> writing six bookes professedly of the Sacraments omitteth the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish five, and spendeth his whole discourse upon our two. If the Church in his time beleeved or administred seven Sacraments, hee could no way be excused of supine negligence for making no mention at all of the greater part of them: it were all one as if a man professing to treate of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the parts of the world which are foure, or of the <hi>Pleiades</hi> or the <hi>Septentriones,</hi> or the Planets which are seven should handle but two of that number. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> therefore and after him <hi>Flood</hi> pluck hard at this thorne, but cannot get it out (saying that <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> his intent was to instruct the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> only, as the title of one of the books sheweth.) For first <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> hath no booke of that title, <hi>viz.</hi> An <hi>instruction to them who are to bee catechized, or are beginners in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie.</hi> The title of that booke is <hi>De ijs qui ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiantur, of those who are initiated or entred into ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mysteries.</hi> Secondly, this is not the title of any of the six bookes <hi>de sacramentis</hi> alledged by the <hi>Knight,</hi> but of another tractate. Thirdly, admit that <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> as <hi>S. Austine</hi> and <hi>Cyrill</hi> wrote to the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> and intended a Catechisme: yet they were to name all the Sacraments unto them, as all Divines usually doe in their Catechismes: because the Sacraments are alwayes handled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the grounds, and principles of Christian religion. And though the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> are not presently admitted unto all, yet they are to learne
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:177104:202"/> what they are, that they may bee the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in due time to receive them. Fourthly, it is evidently untrue (which the <hi>Iesuit</hi> saith) that <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> writeth not to the beleevers of that age, but only to some beginners. The very <hi>front</hi> of his booke proves the <hi>Iesuit</hi> to bee <hi>frontlesse.</hi> For <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> his first words are, <hi>I will begin to speake of the Sacraments which wee have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, &amp;c. In Christiano enim viro prima est fides, for the first thing in a Christian man is faith.</hi> And as hee writeth to all beleevers not beginners on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so hee speaketh also of the chiefe Sacraments of the New Testament, and not of those only which the <hi>catechumeni</hi> received, as is apparant out of the fourth chapter of the first booke <hi>De sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis.</hi> Wherein hee proveth according to the title of that Chapter, <hi>Quòd sacramenta Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum diviniora sint, &amp; priora quàm Iudaeorum, That the Sacraments of the Christians are more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and more divine then those of the Iewes;</hi> and hee instanceth especially in the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> Lastly, the <hi>Iesuit</hi> in this answer apparantly contradicteth himselfe, first, saying that <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> intent in that Worke was only to instruct the <hi>catechumeni</hi> in those things that were to be done <hi>in the time of Baptisme,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">P. 210.</note> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few lines after he saith,<note place="margin">Bud. deasse, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas nonnun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam invitis erumpit ac fallens inter mendacia ab audientibus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum agnosci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur cum inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim loquentes adhuc se habere in potestate putent.</note> that he <hi>writeth of the Sacraments whereby they were so initiated which are three, Baptisme, Confirmation, and the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist.</hi> So true is <hi>Budaeus</hi> his observation, That lyes dash one with the other, and truth breakes out of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:177104:202"/> the mouth of the lyar ere hee is aware.

                        <p>To the eight. That it may appeare what was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> the judgement of S. <hi>Austine</hi> in this maine point of difference, betweene the Reformed and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, I will weigh what is brought on both sides, first what the <hi>Iesuit</hi> alledgeth for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and then what the <hi>Knight</hi> for two. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> having written divers Catechisticall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, in which hee had occasion to name and handle the Sacraments: yet no where defineth the number of them to bee seven, neither nameth all of them either joyntly or severally: this the <hi>Iesuit</hi> knowing well enough, bringeth no one testimonie for the proofe of their seven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of him, but forceth only some senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to prove out of them that hee held more then two, as namely out of his first Sermon upon the 103. Psalme, <hi>Cast thine eyes upon the gifts or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Church in Baptisme, the Eucharist, and the rest of the holy Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>Epist.</hi> 118.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:177104:203"/> having brought in two Sacraments, Baptisme and the Lords Supper, hee addeth such a generall clause, <hi>and if there bee any thing else commended in holy Scriptures;</hi> which words of his import that hee held more sacraments then Baptisme and the Lords Supper, in that very sense wherein those two by him named are called Sacraments. I answer, <hi>S. Austine</hi> in neither of these places ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the word Sacrament in a strict sense: but in a large for every sacred rite commended in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or gift and office of the Church. As for the word <hi>coeteris,</hi> the <hi>Iesuit</hi> insisteth upon: it impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth only a generical convenience and similitude not a specificall; and so wee acknowledge that there are many sacred rites in the Church, which agree with Baptisme and the Lords Supper in the genericall notion of Sacraments: but not in the specificall as the word Sacrament is taken for a peculiar seale of the New Testament, having thereunto annexed a promise of justifying grace. Now let us weigh what the <hi>Knight</hi> alledgeth out of S. <hi>Austine</hi> for two Sacraments only,<note place="margin">De doct. Chris. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi>
                           </note>
                           <hi>Our Lord</hi> (saith that Father) <hi>and his Apostles have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto us a few Sacraments in stead of many, in performance most easie, in signification most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as is the Sacrament of Baptisme and the Lords Supper.</hi> To disappoint this testimonie, the <hi>Iesuit</hi> first layeth corruption and falsification to the <hi>Knights</hi> charge, because S. <hi>Austines</hi> words are <hi>signa pauca,</hi> not <hi>sacramenta.</hi> Which is nothing but a meere cavill, for <hi>signa</hi> and <hi>sacramenta</hi> are in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:177104:203"/>
                           <hi>S.

For <hi>S. Iohn</hi> speaking of our Saviour saith, <hi>vidimus gloriam ejus sicut unigeniti filij Dei, Wee beheld the glorie as of the only begotten Sonne of the Father.</hi> Will the <hi>Iesuit</hi> from thence inferre that God had more only begotten sonnes? but to expound <hi>S. Austine</hi> out of himselfe those signes or Sacraments which here hee calls a few, in his 118. Epistle hee tearmes <hi>most few (Sacramentis numero paucissimis)</hi> surely seven Sacraments are not <hi>numero paucissima,</hi> fewest in number, but two are so: and therefore in his booke <hi>De symbolo ad catechumenos,</hi> he tearmeth them <hi>gemina Ecclesiae sacramenta;</hi> which passage the <hi>Iesuit</hi> taketh no notice of, because hee could give no answer at all unto it, yet hee setteth a good face upon the matter saying, this may suffice for such testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as were alledged out of <hi>S. Austine.</hi> Of all the Roman Captaines I cannot liken him fitter to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny then to <hi>Terentius Varro,</hi> who though hee fought so unhappily against <hi>Hanniball</hi> at <hi>Cannae,</hi> that hee lost 40000. men upon the place, yet hee
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:177104:204"/> seemed to bee little daunted therewith, and the Roman Senat sent him publike thankes, <hi>quòd de republicâ non desperâsset,</hi> that <hi>hee despaired not of the Common-wealth.</hi>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> To the ninth. The authour of the treatise <hi>De ablutione pedum,</hi> who was farre later then <hi>S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> mentioneth indeed five sacraments which are more then two, yet lesse then seven, and for those five hee nameth, it is evident hee intended not that they were Sacraments in a strict sense. For one of them is <hi>ablutio pedum,</hi> which if it bee a Sacrament in the proper sense, then hath the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit</hi> an eighth sacrament as himselfe is <hi>sapientum octavus. Not so,</hi> saith hee, for <hi>ablutio pedum</hi> which that Authour meaneth is the sacrament of Penance. Then belike <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apostles did <hi>Penance</hi> whilest <hi>Christ washed their feet.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there may lie hid some mysterie in that ablution, and therefore it may bee tearmed a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in a large sense,<note place="margin">L. <hi>2.</hi> de sac. c. <hi>24.</hi>
                           </note> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> expoundeth that authour. Yet our Lord himselfe revealeth unto us no other mysterie, nor maketh any other inference from it then a patterne of humilitie,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.14.</note>
                           <hi>If I your Lord and Master have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one anothers feet.</hi> Yea but (saith <hi>Flood,</hi>) the authour speaketh of another Laver after Baptisme, and what can that bee other then Penance?

                        </p>
                        <p>To the tenth. The <hi>Iesuit</hi> in his answer to <hi>S. Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> bewrayes extreame negligence. For the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
                           <hi>Knight</hi> quoting <hi>S. Isidore</hi> at large in his sixt book, and not naming any chapter, this <hi>Desultorius Miles</hi> posting through one chapter, and finding not the words there, chargeth the <hi>Knight</hi> with falsification; whereas in the chapter immediatly following, to wit, the 19. according to the later edition of <hi>S. Isidore</hi> (but in the 18. according to the former) the testimonie alledged by the <hi>Knight</hi> is found in expresse words, and <hi>Baptisme, Chrisme, and the Lords Supper reckoned by him for the Sacraments of the Church there,</hi> without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any other; If hee had held seven sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, questionlesse in that place hee would have named all, or at least the major part of them. The <hi>Iesuit</hi> applieth a plaister to this sore, to wit, that else-where the same Father mentioneth Penance
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:177104:205"/> and Matrimonie. But the plaister is too narrow, and the salve of no vertue at all. First, it is too narrow, for though Penance and Matrimonie be added to Baptisme, Chrisme and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, we have yet but foure (or if we take Chrisme not for a Ceremonie used in Baptisme but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Sacrament from it) at the most, but five: wee are still out of our reckoning, wee heare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Order and Extreame Vnction. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the plaister is too narrow, so the salve spread on it is of no vertue at all. For though <hi>S. Isidore</hi> compareth Penance to Baptisme in respect of the effect thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> washing away of sinne, yet he maketh not thereby Penance a Sacrament. Whatsoever washeth away sinne is not therefore a Sacrament,<note place="margin">Acts 15.9.</note> Faith <hi>purifieth the heart,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaketh;<note place="margin">Luk. 11.41.</note> and Christ himselfe saith, <hi>doe Almes, and all things shall bee cleane unto you;</hi> Yet doth it not from thence follow, that either Faith or Charitie are Sacraments. For Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie he saith indeed <hi>there are three boones or good things in it,</hi> or as the <hi>Iesuit</hi> translateth the words, <hi>three goods of it, fides, proles &amp; sacramentum,</hi> faith, issue, and a Sacrament, but by sacrament there hee understandeth the great mysterie of the union of Christ with his Church, whereof Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie is a signe, and hee alludeth to the words of the Apostle,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.34.</note>

I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that under one kind only all and whole Christ, and the true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are received, as if the Councell had said, <hi>omnis &amp; totus Christus,</hi> whereas the words are, <hi>totus at{que} integer Christus,</hi> that is, whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Christ.</p>
                     <p>In bringing this Decree, hee hath brought a staffe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This was no new thing begun by that Councell, but it being growne to bee a generall practise to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in one kind, which also from the beginning was somewhat practised, and certaine heretiques arising, and condemning the practise and beliefe of the whole Church; this Councell condemned them, and commanded the former custome to bee still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Though Christ did institute the Sacrament in both kindes, yet it is lawfull to receive in one: neither doth the Councell decree any thing against Christs Precept by establishing the Communion in one kind, for Christ may institute a thing without comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it. For example, hee did institute Mariage, yet commanded not every man to marry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> doth not any way contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict Christs institution or practise as the <hi>Knight</hi> would have it: but inferreth only thus much, though
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:177104:213"/> Christ did institute and deliver the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Apostles in both kindes in the last Supper, yet is Christ contained whole and entire in one kind, and a true Sacrament received, wherein saith hee, I would faine see, what opposition the subtiltie of the <hi>Knights</hi> wit can find? what reason can hee give? why it may not stand with Christ his institution in both kinds, that he be whole under one, and if whole, why not also a true Sacrament?</p>
                     <p>The words, <hi>Drinke yee all of this,</hi> and <hi>doe this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> in remembrance of mee</hi> were spoken and apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine only to the Apostles, and in them to Priests, as appeareth more plainly by S. <hi>Mark,</hi> who sheweth all which our Srviour meant of when hee said, <hi>Drinke yee all of this,</hi> for saith S. <hi>Marke,</hi> and they did drinke all.</p>
                     <p>Though Christ at his last Supper did institute a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Sacrament in both kindes, and so gave it to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: yet Christ might at some other time after his resurrection communicate some of his Disciples in one kind; and some Fathers thinke hee did his two Disciples at <hi>Emmaus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Knight</hi> needeth not to produce ten or eleven <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Authours to prove it to have beene the practise of the primitive Church, to communicate in both kinds: for that would have beene granted him without all that labour: but hee should have proved that the practise was grounded upon some divine precept indispensable, or else it followeth not, but that it is in the power of the Church to alter the practise in the use, and administration of the Sacrament.</p>

                           <hi>Drinke you all of this.</hi> Yet saith that Councell to the Laitie, none of you drinke of this. If Christ had said in like manner, receive you the Communion after supper, we would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive it fasting. It is true that he instituted it the night he was betrayed after supper, which circumstance yet bindeth us not now to receive it at that time: but the argument no wayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes from the change of a circumstance to the change of a substantiall act: the Church may dispence with the one, not with the other. Wee argue not barely from the practise of Christ and his Apostles, but from their doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise. <hi>What Christ did and taught,</hi> as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> soundly collects, must bee perpetually observed in the Church: but he taught and practised the Communion in both kindes, <hi>fecit &amp; docuit,</hi> hee both did so, and taught us so to doe; but for the circumstances of time, number of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, &amp; gesture sitting or leaning, though at that time he used such circumstances: yet he cōmanded not us to use them, and therefore wee may admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the Sacrament at another time, to a greater or lesser number then twelve, we may receive it also with another gesture then Christ or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:177104:216"/> used, because he no where tieth us to those circumstances, but wee may in no wise admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster or receive it in one kind, because he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us to communicate in both, <hi>saying, drinke ye all of this;</hi> and what though the Councell joyne not the word <hi>notwithstanding</hi> to Christs institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in both kindes, but to his administring after supper: yet this no way excuseth the Fathers in it from confronting Christ, and abrogating his commandement by their wicked Decree: for notwithstanding Christs command, <hi>drinke you all of this;</hi> that Councell by a countermaund forbiddeth any Priest under a great penaltie to exhort the people to communicate in both kindes, or to teach that they ought so to doe.</p>
                        <p>To the third. If the <hi>Iesuits</hi> forehead had not beene made of the same metall which hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipeth in his images, hee would have blushed to utter so notorious an untruth contrary to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of all ages, and the confession of all the learned of his owne side. Never any before this <hi>Iesuit</hi> durst to say, that the halfe Communion was the beliefe, and practise of the whole Church before the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> for besides <hi>Salmeron, Arboreus, Aquinas, Tapperus, Alfonsus a Castro:</hi> the Councell of <hi>Constance, Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Cassander</hi> alledged by the <hi>Knight,</hi>

It is well knowne that the Easterne Churches in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and Southern in <hi>Africa,</hi> and Northerne in <hi>Muscovia</hi> have ever, and at this day doe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the Communion to the Laitie in both kindes: and in <hi>the Westerne and Roman Church it selfe for a thousand yeares after Christ and more, the Sacrament was delivered in both kindes to all the members of Christs Church,</hi> which is manifest saith <hi>Cassander,</hi>

Albeit I grant there is some difference betweene an institution, or constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or command: yet our argument drawne from Christs institution in both kindes is of force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Romish halfe Communion. For a command is, as the <hi>genus,</hi> and an Institution is as the <hi>species,</hi> every command is not an institution: but every institution is a command; for what is an institution, but a speciall order or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matter of Ceremonie or Sacrament? was not the institution of Circumcision an expresse
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:177104:217"/> command to circumcise every male child? was not the institution of the Passeover a command for every familie to kill a Lambe, and eate it with sowre herbes? Was not the institution of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme a command to <hi>Baptise all Nations in the name of the Father, Sonne and holy Ghost?</hi> Was not the institution of the Lotds Supper by words imperative, <hi>Take, eate, doe this in remembrance of mee,</hi> and <hi>drinke yee all of this?</hi> Yea but the <hi>Iesuit</hi> instanceth in Mariage, which we acknowledge to be instituted by God, yet not commanded. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, all sacred Rites (and namely the ordination of Mariage) are injunctions and commands to the Church, or mankind in generall, though they bind not every particular person, but such onely as are qualified for them;<note place="margin">Gen. 2.24.</note> if <hi>crescite &amp; multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camini, bee rather a benediction upon Mariage, then a command to marrie,</hi> yet certainly those words used in the Institution of Mariage, <hi>therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall bee one flesh,</hi> containe da direct command not to every man simply I grant, but to every one that hath not the gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie.

                        <p>To the fift. There needs no subtiltie of wit to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> find out the opposition betweene the Decree of the <hi>Trent</hi> Councell and Christs institution; the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:177104:218"/> dullest wit cannot but stumble upon it. For if whole Christ be received in either kind, why did Christ who doth nothing superfluously, institute the Sacrament in both kindes? If the Sacrament can no otherwise exhibit Christ unto us then by vertue of his Institution, how can wee be assured that whole Christ is communicated unto us, when we violate his institution administring the holy Communion but by halfes? the Sacrament exhibiteth nothing but what it signifieth, but the bread signifieth Christs body not his blood: the wine signifieth his blood, not his bodie; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accordingly the one exhibiteth only his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the other his bloud. Againe, if Christ bee whole in either kinde, then a man might receive whole Christ in drinking of the cup only, though he eate not at all of the bread, and consequently a man may without sinne at the Lords board drinke only of the Consecrated cup, and not eate of the bread which yet no Papist to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ever durst affirme.</p>

The generall practise and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Westerne Church, having their publike service in Latine, and of the Easterne Churches, having their service in Greeke, maketh for us, not against us. For the Latine service was generally understood in the Westerne Church, and the Greeke in the Easterne; when and where it was not so generally understood they had their service in their Mother-tongue, as namely among the Syrians, Armenians, Russians, Egyptians, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians.

For certainly what they generally practised in their divine Service, they thought to be fittest and most agreeable to Gods commandement. If wee had nothing but their practise for us, it alone would prove the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie of our Church in this maine point, wherein wee stand at a bay with the Roman Church; but the truth is, though the <hi>Iesuit</hi> would bee loath to heare it, his owne witnesses <hi>Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Belithus, Waldensis,</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> speake home to the point even of a Precept; the words of <hi>Cassander</hi> are, <hi>the Canonicall prayers, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the words of Consecration of the body and blood of our Lord; the Ancients did so read that all the people might understand it and say Amen according to the precept intimated by the Apostle,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.16. The words of <hi>Belithus</hi> are, <hi>that in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church it was forbidden that any should speake with tongues, unlesse there were some to interpret: for what saith hee, should speaking availe without understanding? Waldensis</hi> saith more then that, in the Apostles time, the giving of thankes was in a knowne tongue, he confirmeth the practise with a reason, saying, <hi>There was reason it should bee so, because in those times not only the Priests, but the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:177104:232"/> people also were wont to answer Amen. Aquinas</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a step farther, that it <hi>was madnesse in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church for a man to have prayed in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue, because then the people were rude and ignorant in Ecclesiasticall rites.</hi> Now if the <hi>Iesuit</hi> thinke that it was not prohibited in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles time, to doe any madde act in time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, he himselfe is bound for the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyrae.</hi> Now for that the <hi>Iesuit</hi> addeth for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellishing of his former answer, that none of the vulgar languages but the three learned, to wit, the Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine, were Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the crosse of Christ, and consequently that they being the best and perfectest of all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages were fittest for divine Service to be said in them: it is more plausible then substantiall. For though I grant that every devout soule so affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the person of our Lord and Saviour, that shee loveth the very ground hee trod upon, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth those languages above all other in which his titles were proclaimed, for the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his kingdome: yet the reason hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in our present case. For though a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den key bee simply better then a key of iron, yet a key of iron which will open to us a casket of most pretious Iewells, is better for that use then a key of gold which will not open the lock. Admit the originall languages of Greeke and Hebrew are simply perfecter, and better then any other which are derivatives from them, yet the Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue, or vulgar language, is better and fitter
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:177104:233"/> for the congregation in time of divine Service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it answereth the <hi>wards of their understanding,</hi> and <hi>openeth</hi> to their capacity the Divine mysteries then celebrated, which the learned languages cannot doe. As for <hi>Pilats</hi> writing over the Crosse, it is certaine he had no end therein to honour the three Languages, with this title: but to dishonour our Saviour thereby, and put a scorne upon him; and therefore that inscription in the three lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages was rather a pollution then a Dedication of those tongues. If <hi>Pilats</hi> action herein bee of any force it maketh rather against then for our Adversaries. For <hi>Pilat</hi> therefore commanded the title to be written in those three languages, that it might be understood of all, or the greater part of those that then were at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> By which reason people of divers languages ought to have their mysteries (for so the <hi>Iesuit</hi> calleth this title) celebrated in their owne severall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.<note place="margin">Praef. in psal. his maximè tribus linguis sacramentum voluntatis Dei, &amp; beati regni expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio praedicatur ex eo{que} illud Pilati fuit, ut in his tribus linguis regem Iudaeorum Dominum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum Iesum Christum esse praescriberet.</note> S. <hi>Hilarie</hi> who is alledged by <hi>Baylie</hi> the Iesuit for the consecration of these tongues, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saith that these tongues were consecrated by that inscription, nor that Christs kingdome is to be proclaimed in them only.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the publike Service of the Church ought to bee in a knowne tongue. If all things ought to be done in the Church to edification, then ought the publike Service to bee in a knowne tongue; (for <hi>hee that speaketh in an unknowne tongue edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not,</hi> v. 5.) but in the Church all <hi>things ought to bee done to edification,</hi> v. 26. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the publike Service ought to bee in a knowne tongue: If in the prayers of the Church the people are to joyne with the Priest, and testifie their consent with him by saying <hi>Amen</hi> to his prayers, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thankes: then ought the publike Service

Thirdly, for more prevalencie with God, when we <hi>offer violence,</hi> as it were to heaven, and send up our united devotions like a <hi>vollie of shotte to batter the walls of it;</hi> They who pray in a tongue which the people understand not, and therefore cannot joyne with them in their prayer, faile of all these ends.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:177104:236"/> it; secondly, it is blasphemous to say that to desire to understand the particular contents of the Epistles and Gospels read in the Masse, or the psalmes of <hi>David,</hi> sung in the Church is vaine curiositie, or hereticall pride.

For though this story of the shepheards abusing the words of Consecration, and strucke dead for it, might peradventure occasion some alteration in those Churches, where it was beleeved, yet there was no generall command for the practise of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Service, in all Christian Churches before <hi>Vitalians</hi> time; who in the yeare 666. verified the number of the name of the beast in himselfe, which according to the interpretation of S. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> who flourished within two hundred yeares after Christ, is <hi>lateinos,</hi> as before I noted. But for mine owne part I have no faith at all in that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendarie fable of the Sheepheards; First because those that coyned it, agree not in their tale, for some say, that the Bread and Wine were transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated into flesh and bloud, and the sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards for their prophane abuse strucke dead: others tell it otherwise,<note place="margin">Cassand. li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turg. c. <hi>28.</hi> Honorius in Gem. animae, Bellar. l. <hi>2.</hi> de Mis. c. <hi>22.</hi>

Tertullian</hi> living much about the same time, in his booke <hi>De spectaculis</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that God hath forbidden the likenesse of any thing to be made, much more the likenesse of his owne image: the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of truth doth not love any thing that is false or counterfeit, and all that is feigned or formed by art of him, is nothing but counterfeit.

Thirdly, if it bee an honour to images to be removed out of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches according to the purport of this Decree in the <hi>Iesuits</hi> understanding, then the reformed Churches may justly be thought to have shewed the most respect, and done the greatest honour to images of all other, by casheering them out of their Churches, <hi>pra amore excluserunt foras,</hi> no

The instance is not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> whose punishment Saint <hi>Paul</hi> released, was alive; our question is of Indulgences, releasing soules after death. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the incestuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and thereby excluded for the time, from the Communion of Saints: our question is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:177104:268"/> of those that died reconciled to the Church, in the state of grace, Whether they by the Popes Indulgence, may receive ought out of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie of Saints sufferings, to purchase their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from Purgatorie, or at least, mittigation of their paines there? Thirdly, the Indulgence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> granted the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> was the relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the sentence of Excommunication, not aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting flames of Purgatorie. Fourthly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> condescended more willingly to grant that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate <hi>Corinthian</hi> his absolution, for the earnest prayers and intreatie of some of his neighbours and friends: hee did not impute the sufferings or merits of his friends unto him, and in that consideration absolved him.

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> To the fourth.

Now it seemed to this Father to be unjust and unfitting, both that the Martyrs in such cases should be intreaters, and that the Church should grant absolution to such persons, or mitigate the censures most iustly imposed upon them. Whether <hi>Tertullian</hi> in this were in the right or not, it makes nothing for the <hi>Iesuit,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, for he speaketh of living Martyrs and not dead: of forgiving the crime it selfe, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the temporall punishment, and that in this life, not in Purgatory. As this is one of the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent allegations in his booke, so he handles it as strangely and absurdly; for first, he discredit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and disableth his witnesse, by branding him with the note of an <hi>Heretique,</hi> and then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth him.</p>
                        <p>To the fift: What <hi>rope of sands</hi> hath the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit</hi> here <hi>twisted;</hi> first he can never prove that any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> man can fully satisfie for the least sinne commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against the infinite maiesty of God, much lesse by any penance he can endure, though never so long, satisfie over and above as he speaketh. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the continuance of his penance, if it bee done in true humility, and sincerity, shall not be without fruit to himselfe, for it shall be a meanes to mortifie his fleshly lusts, and prevent future sins and through faith in Christ, to obtaine a greater
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:177104:269"/> reward in heaven. Thirdly, had the Saints any such <hi>surplussage</hi> of merits, and were there nothing <hi>allowed</hi> to themselves for it here, or hereafter: yet could not these their merits be communicated to others for their behoofe, because God hath set it downe in his law expressely,<note place="margin">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:177104:271"/> than any Merchant or Stationer in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Yet, by the <hi>Iesuits</hi> leave, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> granting 14000 yeares of Pardon, and <hi>Nicolas</hi> the first, as many, and <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, twice as many, which make up the full number of 56000; must needs be thought, to intend benefit to the soules in Purgatorie, or in hell: unlesse you will make the Pope to be so absurd, as to suppose that any were to live upon earth so many thousand yeares, which had beene an errour 55000 times worse than the errour of the <hi>Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries.</hi> For they taught, that the Saints should live a thousand yeares with Christ on earth: but these, that sinners should live in durance here, or in Purgatorie 56000 yeares, which is 50000 yeares longer than by all computations, the World hath, or as most thinke, shall last.</p>

For, the learned <hi>Romanists</hi> generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that Purgatorie fire differeth little from hell, but in time; that the one is eternall, the other temporall: they beleeve it to equalize, or rather exceed any fiery torment on earth.

And as for Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> alleaged by the <hi>Knight</hi> to the contrary, his words are to be meant of the finall and eternall place of soules. For otherwise, Saint <hi>Austine</hi> is so expresse for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, in the very booke and place quoted by the <hi>Knight,</hi> to wit, in his <hi>Enchiridian ad Laurentium,</hi> that <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>.

                     <p>IN this Chapter, the <hi>Iesuit</hi> in the fourth, fift, sixt, seventh, twelfth, fifteene, and sixteene Paragraphs, doth nothing but <hi>seeth againe his old Coleworts,</hi> which were tasted before, and after cast into the dunghill. From whence, I purpose not to gather them againe, or set them before the Reader, lest his stomacke should rise at them: but I addresse my selfe to examine onely such Sophismes, Cavils and Evasions, whereby hee indeavoureth to elude or retort the <hi>Knights</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, brought against him in this Section, in order as I have set them downe.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To the first. The consequence of the <hi>Iesuit,</hi> drawne from the <hi>Knights</hi> supposed failing in his proofes, failes many wayes, as may be proved by manifold instances. For albeit, many later Mathematitians faile in refuting <hi>Copernicus</hi> his giddy opinion of the earths circular motion, and the heavens standing still: yet this their fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is no sufficient proofe of <hi>Copernicus</hi> his new fancie: neither will it follow, that the religion of Pagans &amp; Infidels hath sufficient ground, because <hi>Lactantius</hi> failes in his proofes of Christianitie, in Saint <hi>Ieromes</hi> judgement: and <hi>Cyprian</hi> also in the judgement of <hi>Lactantius.</hi> The defects of the Patron or Advocate, ought not to be imputed to the cause. It is a weake and silly Religion, whose whole strength consisteth in the weakenesse of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:177104:283"/> some of the opposers of it. The truth is, the <hi>Knight</hi> hath not failed in his proofes of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veltie of the <hi>Trent</hi> Creed, as the judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will find: yet if there were any defect in them, it may be abundantly supplied out of <hi>Iuels</hi> challenge at Saint <hi>Pauls Crosse, Abbots</hi> answer to <hi>Bishop,</hi> intituled, The true ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Catholike, and Doctor <hi>Faner</hi> in his Booke of Antiquitie, triumphing over noveltie, and divers others.</p>
                     <p>To the second. That the salvation of all soules <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> dependeth upon the Popes supremacie, which the <hi>Iesuits</hi> are bound by a fourth, and supernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary vow to defend, is a bold and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous assertion, derogatorie to Christ himselfe, who is <hi>the Saviour of his body,</hi>

When Christ said to <hi>Peter, Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rocke will I build my Church;</hi> hee meant not, as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> rightly observeth, <hi>To build himselfe upon</hi> Peter, <hi>but</hi> Peter <hi>and the whole Church upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; non super te edificabo me, sed super me edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabo te.</hi> The Church was founded and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed before there was any Pope or Bishop at <hi>Rome,</hi> and shall so continue, when <hi>Rome shall,</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> To the third. The <hi>Knight</hi> used a dilemma, or two-forked Argument. Either the Popes sworn-Servants, and our sworne enemies, whose depositions before wee heard, against divers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>Trent</hi> Faith, concurred with other Papists in judgement, or not: if they concurred, then by the joynt confession of all, for those points, at least, they are destitute of universality, which yet they make a prime note of their Church: if others concurred not with them in judgement, then their Doctors are divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, and consequently, they want another speciall marke of their Church, which they make unitie in point of Faith. To avoid the <hi>push</hi> of this <hi>Ramme,</hi> the <hi>Iesuit</hi> starts<note n="*" place="margin">Quintil.

Faith before it be defined, and resolveth the matter thus: <hi>When a a thing is once defined, to wit, by the Church, then it becomes a matter of Faith.</hi> Hee should rather determine, because this or that is a matter of Faith, therefore the Church defineth it to be so, and not because the Church defineth it to be so, therefore it is a matter of Faith. For Faith, if it be divine, is founded upon Gods Word, not the Churches definition: if nothing be matter of Faith, before it be defined by your Church, then Transubstantiation was no article of Faith,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:177104:284"/> before the Councell of <hi>Laterane,</hi> and <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third his dayes; nor the Doctrine of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commitancie, and lawfull communicating in one kind, before the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> under <hi>Martin</hi> the fift; nor the Popes superioritie to Councels, before the Councell at <hi>Laterane,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth; nor most of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth his Articles, before the late Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> wherein those points were first defined. Then which, what Argument can be more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, to convince the novelty of the Romish Faith? But whether an article of Faith is to be accounted such, because it is defined to be such by the Church; or whether it be defined to be such by the Church, because it is such in its owne nature; it will little serve the <hi>Iesuits</hi> turne to make up the breaches of the Roman Church. For certaine it is, that their Doctors differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, even in points defined by the Church. For after the bookes of the Old Testament, with all the parts (knowne by the name of <hi>Apocrypha</hi>) by the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> were defined to be of Canonicall authoritie; <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Senensis</hi> makes scruple of some of them.<note place="margin">Sixtus Senens. bib.

It is true, that it is a different thing to dispute of the certainety of the Catholike faith in generall, and of every mans private and particular beliefe of his owne justification, and salvation: yet there is such a dependance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, that if the former be uncertaine the latter cannot be certaine.

Secondly, for the authoritie of the See Apostolike, and the infallibility of the Popes judgement, they are as uncertaine, or more then that such persons ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized by the Pope are Saints.<note place="margin">L. <hi>3.</hi> ep. <hi>3.</hi> nec quisquam sibi quod soli filio tribuit pater vindicare se putet, ut ad areum purgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, &amp;c. <hi>1</hi> Kings <hi>8.39.</hi>
                        </note> Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his time, severely censured those who <hi>arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to themselves that which the Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Sonne onely; to wit, in the floore of the Church, to take the fanne in his hand, and sever the Wheat from the Chaffe.</hi> If God onely <hi>knoweth the hearts of all the children of men,</hi> either the Pope must be God, as the Canonists blasphemously called him, or hee cannot infallibly know who are true Saints, and sincerely beleeve, and love God. As for Saint <hi>Austines</hi> complaint (that many were worshipped by men on earth that are tormented by the devill in hell) they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely spoken, and not restrained to <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> or any other Heretikes: yet, were it so, wee may see in those <hi>Donatists</hi> a perfect picture of

And as the <hi>Donatists</hi> gave the honour of Martyrs to those, who justly suffered death for Robberies and Murders, so doe the Papists crowne the heads of Murderers and Traitours with the garland of Martyrdome; witnesse <hi>Becket, Campian, Oldcorne,</hi> and <hi>Garnet;</hi> whereof the first standeth in the Kalender of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Saints, the later in the Register of Jesuiticall Martyrs. Neither can the <hi>Iesuit</hi> so easily fillip off the testimonie of <hi>Cassander,</hi> as if hee taxed the ignorant for making a Saint of a Thiefe,<note place="margin">Cassan. consult. art. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note> and no way touched upon the Pope or your Church; for hee layeth not the blame upon the people, as the <hi>Iesuit</hi> here doth, but saith simply, that Saint <hi>Martin</hi> found a place honoured in the name of a holy Martyr, to be the sepulcher of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Robber. Secondly, 'tis well knowne that the people cry not up at first a Saint, or Martyr after his death, but the Priests, who voyce mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles upon them, and keepe their Shrines and Reliques, and by shewing them to the people, make no lesse gaine, than <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his fellow Crafts-men did of their silver Shrines of <hi>Diana.</hi>

As hee that plucks the stickes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> out of the Chimney one by one, at last puts out the fire: so the <hi>Knight</hi> by loosening, or quite removing the fuell of Purgatorie fire, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently extinguisheth it. If all the parts and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:177104:289"/> of the Doctrine of Popish Purgatory are doubtfull and uncertaine, the whole certainly can be no Article of Faith: but the Antecedent the <hi>Knight</hi> proves out of <hi>Bellarmine, Dominicus a Soto, Fisher</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester, Gregorie</hi> the great, and venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> let the <hi>Iesuit</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looke to the Consequent. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> commandeth every one upon paine of hell-fire, to beleeve a temporarie purging fire after this life. First, upon what ground, Scripture, or unanimous consent of Fathers, or Tradition of the Catholike Church? no such thing. But upon apparitions of dead men, and testimonie of Spirits, whether good Spirits or evill they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell. Next, wee demand what soules, and how long doe they continue there? To this they must answer likewise <hi>Ignoramus. Soto</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that none continueth in this purgation ten yeares. If this be true, saith <hi>Bellarmine, No soule needs to stay in purging one houre.</hi> Thirdly, the soules that are supposed to be there, till their sinnes are purged, wherewith are they purged? With fire onely; so saith Sir <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> and proves it out of <hi>Zacharie</hi> 9.11. <hi>Thou hast delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the prisoners out of the place where there is no water:</hi> or with water and fire: so saith <hi>Gregorie</hi> in his Dialogues, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Some are purged by fire, and some by bathes:</hi> and <hi>Fisher</hi> Bishop of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> proves it out of those words of the <hi>Psalmist, Wee have passed thorow fire and water.</hi> Fourthly, admit they are purged by fire, whether is this

If all Papists did agree in this, that all Images were to be worshipped, but not as Gods; yet are they at odds in other Quillets concerning Images; namely, whether they are to be worshipped in themselves, and for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or onely <hi>ratione prototypi,</hi> in regard of that they represent: whether properly, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly: whether with kissing and imbracing, and other civill complements, as <hi>Tharasius</hi> the Patriarke of <hi>Constantinople</hi> teacheth, or with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, or corporall submission before Images, as the <hi>Iesuit</hi> indeavoureth to prove out of the Acts of the second Councell of <hi>Nice.</hi> Neither is it certaine, and resolved among all Papists, that Images are to be worshipped, but not as Gods. For some of them deny, that they are at all to be worshipped, others over-lavish on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and teach, that they are to be worshipped as God.<note place="margin">De Imag. sanct. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>22.</hi>
                        </note> For though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe approve not the opinion of those Roman Catholikes, who teach that <hi>Latria,</hi> or divine honour is due to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, unlesse it be improperly, and by accident; yet hee confesseth that <hi>Alexander de Hales, Aquinas, Cajetanus, Bonaventure, Marsilius, Almaine, Carthusian, Capreolus,</hi> and <hi>Henricus</hi> teach, that <hi>The Images of God are to be worshipped with the same worship wherewith God himselfe is worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;</hi> and what is this lesse, than to worship Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as God? As for the Canons and curses of the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> they are but <hi>Bruta fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and if the <hi>Iesuit</hi> be not as senselesse as the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:177104:291"/> Images which hee worshippeth, hee must needs confesse as much. For to speake nothing of the ridiculous arguments used in that Councell, such as these are; <hi>God made Man after his owne Image, therefore we may make or worship Images:</hi> and the <hi>Angels are to be painted,</hi> quia corporei sunt, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are bodily substances.</hi> What is there spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the 115 <hi>Psalme,</hi> the 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, against Idols, which may not be applied to your Popish Images? It is said of them, <hi>They are the workes of mens hands;</hi> are yours the worke of Angels, or Devils? It is said of them, <hi>They have mouthes and speake not, eyes and see not, eares and heare not, noses and smell not, hands and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not, feet and walke not:</hi> doe any of your vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Images made of silver and gold (or rather, of which you make so much silver and gold of) speake, see, heare, smell, handle or walke? I conclude therefore in the words of the <hi>Psalmist, They that make these Images are like unto them, and so are all they that defend the worship of them.</hi> For <hi>Gregorie de Valentia,</hi> the <hi>Iesuit</hi> telleth but a sorry tale; for first, hee disparageth his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Greeke, saying, that alleaging a Text out of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who wrote in Greeke, hee followed the Latine translation, never look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the originall: which argueth in him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grosse ignorance in the Greeke, or grosse negligence.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The Protestant religion is not safer then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in regard of the all-sufficiency of Scripture, on which the Protestants relie, for the <hi>Catholikes</hi> relie upon the same ground of safety, acknowledging and reverencing the authority of Scripture, as much, nay much more then Protestants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> It is not safer to adore Christ (as Protestants doe) sitting at the right hand of his Father in Heaven,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:177104:293"/> then to adore the Sacrament: for Christ is as surely in the Sacrament as in heaven, the same Catholique faith teaching both verities; and to make you study a little, saith hee, I may say in some sort, more sure; for a man that would be contentious, may deny Christ to sit at the right hand of his Father, because his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath neither right hand, nor left.</p>
                  <p>There is no more fafety in the Protestant doctrine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of Iustification, than the Romane. For Catholikes trust wholy in God, attributing no more to their owne good workes, than that they cooperate to Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, meriting grace and glorie: and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Protestants teach vaine confidence in most of these points, as that a man must assure himselfe that his sinnes are forgiven, that hee must assure himselfe of his salvation, and that he cannot fall from grace, and the like: which ground supposed, how can hee worke out his salvation with feare and trembling? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though some Catholikes say, that there is more perfection of the Sacrament, which consisteth in the representation in both kinds, than in one; yet there is the same safety and fruit in one, and in both kinds.</p>
                  <p>Though the sacrifice of the Masse is more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> when the people comnunicate with the Priest, as the <hi>Knight</hi> proveth out of the Councell of <hi>Trent, Harding</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> yet hee proveth not, that there is any danger in private Masses, or that it is unlawfull for the Priest to say Masse without hee have some to communicate with him, which is the Controversie between Catholikes and Protestants.</p>

                     <hi>Aeneas Sylvius, Cassander,</hi> and <hi>Panormitan</hi> are of opinion indeed, that Priests should have libertie to marry: yet they would not have them marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the law standing in force, but they would have the law taken away: which is a farre different Doctrine from that of Protestants. Howsoever, it is safer to follow the judgement of all other Doctours of the Catholike Church, all other Fathers and Councels teaching the contrarie; of all which, there is abundant proofe in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and which was never contradicted by any, but knowne wicked men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Though publike Prayers in Latine may not be so profitable to the people, yet they are lawfull and safe, and the fruit of refection of the understanding by Prayer in a knowne tongue, whereof <hi>Aquinas</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, will not countervaile the tenth part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience which may happen by having publike Prayers in a knowne tongue. The inconveniences are vanitie, curiositie, contempt of Superiours, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, schismes, prophanation, and divulgation of secret Mysteries: besides, the very ignorance of the Latine tongue, and consequently, of all learning which would follow thereof onely in Clergie men, is ten hundred times more harme, than that fruit in the Laitie is good. <hi>Cajetan</hi> was greatly mistaken, when hee expoundeth the fourteenth chapter of the first Epistle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corynthians,</hi> of publike Prayers in the Church: and hee is also mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the very end of Prayer, which is not edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or instruction of the people, but the honour of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:177104:294"/> God immediately. <hi>Gabriel Biel</hi> speaketh not of Prayer in a knowne tongue, nor of publike Prayers, but onely of mentall Prayer, and vocall; and giveth those seven reasons which the <hi>Knight</hi> alleageth, to shew, that besides mentall Prayer, it is convenient to use vocall.</p>
                  <p>There is no danger in worshipping Images, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> praying to Saints: and <hi>Erasmus, Cassander,</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> who teach the contrary, are of none authoritie.</p>
                  <p>Neither <hi>Bernard,</hi> nor <hi>Waldensis,</hi> nor <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> contradict the Doctrine of the Romish Church in the point of Merit. For Catholikes acknowledge with <hi>Bernard,</hi> that there is no safe rest or securitie for a weake soule, but in the wounds of our Saviour; which doth not hinder but a man may say, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth the good workes of his servants, out of his justice and fidelitie, which out of his mercie he gave them grace to doe: and though <hi>Waldensis</hi> and some other Divines, approve not of the word of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, especially <hi>De condigno;</hi> yet in the thing it selfe, they all agree, to wit, that eternall life is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to men, as the reward of their good workes: which is all that others meane by condigne Merit. The Doctrine of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to wit, that it is most safe to trust wholly in the Merits of Christ, is as well the Catholike Doctrine, as the Protestants: who condemne not Protestants for not trusting in their workes, or trusting wholly in Christ; if so be they deny not the necessitie and efficacie of good workes, for purchasing grace and glorie.</p>

For here he proves by many remarkable instances, that <hi>our rocke is much more sure then theirs, our very adversaries being judges;</hi> his instances are prayers in a knowne tongue, communicating in both kindes, partaking of the Sacrament with the Priest, immediate addresse to God by Christ, adoring the Creator onely, resolution of our faith upon Gods word, relying wholly upon his Grace and mercy, and renouncing mans merit. And whose understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehendeth not, that it is safest to pray to God with understanding; whose spirituall sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses tell him not that it is more comfortable and profitable to communicate with a Priest then to looke on, and to receive the Sacrament in both kindes, then in one onely; whose reason per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth him not that it is safer to worship God in spirit, then by an Image; to adore Christ in Heaven, then in a peece of bread; to expect ayde from God, then Saints; to trust in Gods word, then in mans; in his Grace, then our will;

                     <p>To the first. The <hi>Knight</hi> doth not conclude <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> out of any one particular, but maketh an inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of many particulars in this manner. The Protestant faith by the best learned among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists in the point of Communion in both kindes, of Prayer in a knowne tongue, justification by Faith alone, <hi>et sic de ceteris,</hi> is safer then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: <hi>ergo,</hi> simply and generally it is safer. Though <hi>Silurus</hi> his Son could breake every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row by it selfe, which his Father gave him, yet he could not in like manner the bundle or sheafe of Arrowes which he put in his hand, and bid him assay to breake them if he could, —<hi>nam vis unita fortior.

                     <p>To the second. By the uncharitable censure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the <hi>Iesuit,</hi> he sheweth of what spirit he is. The searcher of all hearts knoweth that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict Romish doctrines, not out of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to man, but out of obedience to him who commandeth us to <hi>contend for the true faith:</hi> and to <hi>reprove and convince all gainesayers.</hi> What Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:177104:296"/> intentions are, we take not upon us to judge: their doctrines we <hi>put to the test of Gods word,</hi> and finde them <hi>false and adulterine,</hi> and all be it some points of their beliefe, considered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, might seeme indifferent: yet as they hold them they are not, because they are not of faith,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23.</note> and <hi>whatsoever is not of faith is sinne.</hi> Now no point of the Romish Creed as they hold it, is of that faith the Apostle speaketh of, that is, divine faith; because they ground and finally resolve all their articles not upon Gods word, but upon the authority of the Pope,<note place="margin">Resp ad Archi- epis.

It is neither in words set downe in Scripture, as the other Articles are; neither can it be necssarily inforced or deduced by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, as foure great Cardinals of the Roman

Thirdly, the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit</hi> contradicteth himselfe within eight lines: for having said in the eighteenth line,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 384.</note> that <hi>Christ his corporall presence in the Sacrament was more sure, than his presence in heaven at the right hand of his Father;</hi> about seven lines after, forgetting himselfe, hee saith, that <hi>Wee shall find as much to doe</hi> (marke as much, not more) <hi>in expounding that Article of the Creed, as they doe in expounding the words, This is my Body.</hi> Wherein it is well hee confesseth, that Papists make much to doe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> which is most true; for by the demonstrative <hi>Hoc,</hi> they understand they know not what. Neither this Body, nor this Bread, but an <hi>Individum vagum,</hi> something contained under the accidents of Bread, which when the Priests saith <hi>Hoc,</hi> it is Bread; but when hee hath <hi>muttered out an Vm,</hi> it is Christs Body. Likewise by the <hi>Copula est (is)</hi> they understand they know not what; either shall be, as soone as the words are spoken, or is converted unto, or is by Transubstantiation. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Body, they understand such a body as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is no body, without the extension of place, without distinction of Organs, without facultie of sense, or motion: and will hee make this fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so incredible, so impossible, as sure, nay
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:177104:298"/> more sure than the Article of Christs ascension into heaven, and his sitting at the right hand of his Father there?

They are in danger both wayes, of Will-worship if he be there; of Idolatrie, if hee be not there. Of Will-worship, I say, if hee be under the accidents of Bread and Wine, because they are no where commanded to worship him under such formes: if hee bee not there, then are they apparantly guiltie of grosser Idolatrie, by exhibiting <hi>Cultum latriae,</hi> divine worship to a piece of Bread.</p>

The first is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily plucked out; for the <hi>Knight</hi> chargeth them
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:177104:298"/> with nothing, but what the <hi>Iesuit</hi> himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth. For if men cooperating to their justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, merit both grace and glorie, they doe not ascribe the whole glorie of it to God; but as the Romans, for the victorie they gained over the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> sacrificed <hi>Deo &amp; Mario:</hi> so doe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists at this day, for the conquest of their ghostly enemies, and their purchase of heaven, burne incense <hi>Deo &amp; Mariae,</hi> to Christ and <hi>Mary,</hi> and attribute their justification and salvation, partly to Christs merits, partly to their owne; together with the superabundant satisfaction of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other Saints. The other forke reacheth not home to invenome our most wholsome doctrine, concerning assured hope of salvation: for though wee teach, that a man ought to be assured that his sinnes are forgiven him: yet withall wee teach, that this assurance is upon condition of Repentance and Faith. And withall wee affirme, because hee stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not by his owne strength, but by Gods power, <hi>Who worketh in him both the will and the deed; hee ought not to be high minded, but to feare, and in this feare to worke out his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> I meane, in feare:<note place="margin">

For the trembling here meant, is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:177104:299"/> not onely joyned with assured hope, that God will worke both the will and the deede, but also <hi>with joy, rejoyce unto him with trembling.</hi>

The <hi>Iesuit</hi> here onely troubleth the water, that the truth may not be clearely seene in the bottome; let the water but settle a little, and we shall presently discerne it: for though the tearmes be different, profitable, and lawfull, as likewise unprofitable and unlawfull: yet the question, whether prayers in an unknown tongue be profitable and safe for the soule, and whether they be lawfull or coincident. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is unlawfull, is consequently unprofitable, and whatsoever is unprofitable in divine service is unlawfull, because against the rule of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>let all things be done to edification;</hi> now in a prayer which a man understandeth not, how is the understanding bettered? or as <hi>Aquinas</hi> speaketh, <hi>fed by the fruit of refection.</hi> As for the inconveniences that are pretended to come by prayers in the vulgar tongue, neither the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> nor the <hi>Greeke</hi> Churches, nor all the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Christian world finde any such: and if there should fall any such, they are not to be imputed to Gods Holy Ordinances, but to mens abuses. Yea, but saith the <hi>Iesuit, the very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Latine tongue, and consequently of all
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:177104:300"/> learning that would follow thereon onely in Clergie men, is a thousand times more harme, than the fruit in the Laitie is good.</hi> Here the <hi>Iesuit</hi> straineth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high, but without all shew of reason, or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Truth, and against daily experience: for who knoweth not, that the Clergie in the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, where Divine Service is in the vulgar tongue, are as ready and expert (to say no more) in the Latine tongue, as your ordinary Masse-priests. Againe, you are exceedingly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavish, in saying, that ignorance in Latine in Clergiy-men, is a thousand times more harme than that fruit is good which the Laitie might reape by the publike service in a knowne tongue. For the Clergie are but exceeding few, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the Laitie, scarse one for a hundred, I may say a thousand; and the saving knowledge which the Laitie might, and doe reape by the Divine Service, and Sacred Scripture read in a knowne tongue, is a thousand times more worth, than the knowledge of the Latine tongue in the Clergie. Lastly, his consequence, that the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Latine tongue would bring with it the ignorance of all Sacred learning, is most ignorantly absurd. For who knoweth not, that the Scriptures themselves (the treasurie of all Sacred learning) were written in Hebrew and Greeke. To say nothing of the first generall Councels, and the prime and flower of all the Greeke Fathers, to the knowledge of whom a man may attaine without any Latine at all. But

                     <p>ALthough in this Chapter the <hi>Iesuit</hi> lye as open to the lash, as in any of the former; yet partly because hee is like him in the Poet, that was so tawed and fleade with rods, that there was no skin left on his body for a new stroke to fetch off: partly because, <hi>Page</hi> 406, hee confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth hee cannot tell what to say to the <hi>Knight;</hi> but especially, because the Argument of this Chapter is most fully and accurately handled by D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> and D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> in their answer to <hi>Campian</hi> his fift reason, and in a singular Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise lately set forth by <hi>Laurentius,</hi> intituled, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verentia Ecclesiae Romanae erga sanctos patres.</hi> I will forbeare to examine the severall Paragraphs in this Chapter, (wherein, whatsoever is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, is refuted in the answers to the former Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions) onely I will point at some notorious fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities and absurdities, if not to rectifie the <hi>Iesuits</hi> judgement, yet to disabuse the credulous Reader. First, hee denieth not that the Romane Doctors above mentioned, utter those disgracefull spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:177104:304"/> of Saint <hi>Austen, Origen, Theodoret, Cyprian, Tertullian,</hi> and the rest, but he addeth that they <hi>gave other answers to our objections out of those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> What is that to the purpose, or against the <hi>Knight?</hi> who denieth not that Popish writers have other shifts and evasions to our arguments drawne from the testimony of ancient Fathers besids those, which are here set down in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which are refuted by <hi>Chamierus, Iunius:</hi> and for the better part of them by me in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sections: but he produced these passages onely to shew the <hi>Romanists</hi> disrespect and sleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening of the ancient Fathers, if in any thing they crosse their <hi>Trent</hi> Faith. Secondly, to touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some particulars, how ridiculously and absurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth the <hi>Iesuit</hi> speake, Pag. 417. <hi>Epiphanius saith in plaine manner, that the Image which he saw hang in the Church at</hi> Anablatha, <hi>and tare downe the vale in which it was drawne, was not the Image of Christ or any Saint, but the Image of a man, he knew not whom; which if it had bin Christs, or any Saints he would have knowne whose it was, neither would he have called the Image of Christ or any Saint the Image of a man.</hi> Why I pray you? is not Christ a man? were not Saints men? What should <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius</hi> have said else, who saw there the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of the feature, and liniaments of a man, but knew not what man that was? he saith, <hi>he saw a vaile having on it the Image as if it had beene of Christ, or some Saint, for he knew not whose it was.</hi> If he knew not whose it was, for
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:177104:304"/> ought he knew it might be made for the Image of Christ, or any Saint. Vpon what ground then doth the <hi>Iesuit</hi> say, that <hi>it was neither the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Christ nor of any Saint?</hi> Thirdly,<note place="margin">

                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Another thing I am to note concerning his quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Canon of the Councell of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in first is to be noted his error in Chronologie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the time of this Councell, which he maketh to be in the yeare <hi>368.</hi> forty three yeares after the first Councell at <hi>Nice;</hi> whereas it was celebrated before that Councell.

                  <p>Whereas the <hi>Knight</hi> objecteth to us the recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> of <hi>Henry Buxhorne,</hi> who was sometime appointed to put in execution the tyrannicall Decree of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors, and had noted <hi>600.</hi> severall passages to be spunged and blotted out; which animadversions of his he wished he could have washed away with his teares and blood, his heart being smitten, and his eyes open by the mercy of God: I answere, if such matter will serve the <hi>Knights</hi> turne he may have enough: neither neede I search corners to finde out such obscure fellowes, as this <hi>Buxhorne;</hi> he might bring the Fathers of the <hi>Knights</hi> religion: for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Luther, Calvine, Zuinglius, Beza, Carol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stadius,</hi> and who not? for though they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend severall causes, yet there was one principall one, which consisted indeede in the smiting of their hearts with a fiery dart of carnall love, and when they found an <hi>Eve</hi> to give them an Apple, then their eyes were opened, and so it proved also with their friend <hi>Buxhorne,</hi> as I shall shew by a briefe story of his life, most authentically related by that grave and Holy man <hi>Oliverius,</hi> of the society of <hi>Jesus.

                     <p>IN the former Section, the <hi>Iesuit</hi> shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a prevaricatour, but in this a cowardly runnagate. For to the mangling of authors, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing out of Records objected against him, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this marginall note out of <hi>Stephanus</hi> his Bible, <hi>Deus prohibet sculptilia fieri.</hi> This <hi>Glosse</hi> upon <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian the Priest, cannot say significatively of the bread, This is my Body, without telling a lie, Cassanders</hi> observation upon the same words, that <hi>setting aside the authoritie of the Church, they prove not sufficiently Transubstantiation, Cassanders</hi> whole Tract concerning the Communion in both kinds, <hi>Vdalricus</hi> his Epistle touching the lawfulnesse of Priests marriage, <hi>Anselmes</hi> Treatise concerning the visitation of the sicke, together with divers passages in <hi>Cassander</hi> against merit, in <hi>Polydor Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> against Images, in <hi>Langus</hi> against Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, in <hi>Ferus</hi> against the Popes suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The <hi>Iesuit</hi> answereth nothing at all in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but onely applies <hi>Salves in generall,</hi> which no way <hi>heale the wounds given</hi> by the <hi>Knight</hi> to the Inquisitors, as the Reader shall see by taking <hi>them off</hi> one after another, and viewing the <hi>Sores.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To the first. The <hi>Iesuits</hi> instance is wide from the purpose. For those Books were not burnt by any decree of the Church, much lesse the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was not then in being: but by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:177104:307"/> the owners of them, to testifie their unfeined Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; for so wee reade, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.19. <hi>Many also of them, brought their Bookes together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it</hi> 50000 <hi>pieces of silver.</hi> Secondly, these Bookes which the owners burnt of their owne accord, were Bookes of such as used <hi>curious Arts;</hi> that is, Books of Art-magick, Necromancie, Sorcerie, and the like. Whereas, the Bookes which the Romish Inquisitours either mangle or utterly deface are Christian Treatises, written for the most part by them, that lived and died in the bosome and peace of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the second. This Decree of <hi>Gelasius</hi> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the <hi>Iesuit</hi> opposeth, as a Buckler against all our darts, is not altogether approved by the present Romane Church; for in reckoning the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bookes of Scripture, the Pope there exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the booke of <hi>Baruch,</hi> and the second booke of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> and the booke of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> which the present Romane Church receiveth for Canonicall. Secondly, <hi>Gelasius</hi> with his Roman Councell, freely give their censure of all Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall bookes then extant, but they clip not the tongues of any Authors, nor burne their bookes. If the Romish Inquisitors had done no more, if they had let the Records and Evidences remaine, and onely censured them at their pleasure; wee would not so much have blamed them, for using the freedome of their judgements: wee would
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:177104:308"/> only freely have <hi>censured their Censures,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lips. Epist. Critica nostra non effugêre <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> and left all to the judicious and intelligent Readers judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. An errour in Criticisme is pardonable, but the making away of the evidence of Truth,<note place="margin">Advers.

                     <p>To the third. <hi>Gelasius</hi> his testimonie of the Romane Church, whereof hee was then Bishop, can be of no great moment. It seemeth at that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> time, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> wanted good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that the Pope was faine to <hi>blazon his owne armes, and guild his owne Diocese;</hi> not thinking of the old Proverbe, <hi>Laus propria sordet in ore.</hi> Howbeit, wee grant in <hi>Gelasius</hi> his time, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church had not <hi>many spots and wrinkles,</hi> for then shee was young in comparison; now she is <hi>old and decrepit, and all full of wrinkles: and after the manner of crooked old age, boweth downe,</hi> to wit, <hi>to rood-lofts, Images, and Pictures.</hi> But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then nor now, hath shee any power to forbid the use of any Books through the whole Church: but onely within her owne jurisdiction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> To the fourth. This Plaister is a great deale too narrow for the Sore of the Romane Church, to which the <hi>Iesuit</hi> applieth it. For it is not their admonitions to the Children of their owne Church, which we here complaine of; but their <hi>cutting out of the tongues of learned Authors, when they witnesse the truth:</hi> not the censuring their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:177104:308"/> own Writers, but the mangling of some of them, and utterly abolishing others. Vnder colour of taking away <hi>Rats-bane out of the way,</hi> they take away <hi>Sugar</hi> from their Children; and which is worse, debarre them from the <hi>sincere Milke of the Word,</hi> I meane, the Scriptures in the vulgar language. Yet were there <hi>Rats-bane,</hi> in some of the Writers with whom the Inquisitours have to deale, they should have onely given notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or prescribed some Antidote against it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that Physitians, and Apothecaries, and Housholders also, make good use of <hi>Rats-bane</hi> sometimes.</p>
                     <p>To the fift. The <hi>Iesuit</hi> doth well, not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> justifying of the Inquisition, which hee well knoweth hee is not able: onely here and there hee nibleth at some Author or other that hath falne into their hands, as <hi>Bertram</hi> in this place: whom the <hi>Knight</hi> long agoe rescued, and gave unto him the <hi>wings of the Presse to flie abroad;</hi> whereby hee hath received no disgrace, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thankes from all that <hi>love the Truth in since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</hi> For the translation thereof, which the <hi>Iesuit</hi> imputeth to the <hi>Knight,</hi> as a great dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to him; the truth is, the <hi>Knight</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated not <hi>Bertram,</hi> but published the translation of another, by re-printing it, and gracing it with a learned and elegant Preface of his owne. Which, I marvell not that the <hi>Iesuit kicketh</hi> at, because hee and his fellow <hi>Iesuits</hi> are <hi>sore Galled</hi> with it. When the <hi>Iesuit</hi> shall prove any falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:177104:309"/> in the translated Copie, or any errour inserted into it, hee shall receive a further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> To the sixt. In citing the Councell of <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi> and detecting the Inquisitours foule dealing with it, by turning <hi>Angels into Angles,</hi> to gaine a <hi>starting hole</hi> for their Idolatrie: the <hi>Iesuit</hi> by recrimination objecteth to the <hi>Knight,</hi> errour in Chronology, and corruption of the Councell. To the first I answer, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:177104:312"/> thereof is doubtfull, but onely that our rule will be uncertaine, or rather wee uncertaine of the rule, because wee cannot know the Scripture by it selfe.</p>
                  <p>It is not all one to say that Scripture alone is no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> sufficient Rule, and to say it is imperfect. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Knight</hi> imagineth, that the All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie, or containing of all things expressely, is a necessarie point of perfection, hee is deceived; for then would it follow, that the Gospell of Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> and other particular Bookes should be imperfect, and especially that of Saint <hi>John,</hi> wherein hee saith expressely, that all things are not written.</p>
                  <p>Were the Scripture perfect in the <hi>Knights</hi> sense, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> yet would it not then be a sufficient rule of Faith of it selfe alone; for it would still be a booke or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the very nature whereof, doth not suffer it to be the sole rule of Faith, or judge of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies; for a Iudge must be able to speake, to heare, and to answer, whereas, the nature of a Booke is, as it were, to leave it selfe to be read, and expounded by men.</p>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:177104:315"/> Holy Fathers, that by the Scriptures we cannot prove, which bookes of Scripture are Canonicall, and which are not. I answere: first, our questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, is not of the principles of Divinity, but of Theologicall conclusions. Now that Scripture is the word of God, and that these bookes are Canonicall Scriptures, are principles in Divinity, and therefore not to be proved (according to the rule of the great Philosopher) in the same science: It is sufficient to make good our Tenet, that the Canonicall Scriptures being presupposed as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, every conclusion <hi>de fide,</hi> may be deduced out of them. Secondly, that such bookes of Holy Scriptures are Canonicall, and the rest which are knowne by the name of <hi>Apochrypha,</hi> are not Canonicall, is proved by arguments and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies drawne out of Scripture it selfe, by <hi>Whitaker, Disputatione de sacrâ Scripturâ, controversiâ primâ;</hi> by <hi>Reynolds</hi> most copiously in his <hi>Censura librorum Apochryphorum.</hi> Thirdly, I retorte the <hi>Iesuits</hi> argument against himselfe, when they teach tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is part of Gods word, how prove they it to be so? by Scripture, or Tradition? by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they cannot prove, that unwritten traditions are Gods word: if they prove it by Tradition, then they begge the point in question, and prove <hi>idem per idem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the second. The <hi>Romanists</hi> ground some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> doctrines of their faith upon the letter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it is <hi>that letter which killeth,</hi> as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; they ground their carnall presence of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:177104:316"/> Christ in the Sacrament, upon those words in the sixt of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Iohn; unlesse yee eate the flesh of the Sonne of God and drinke his blood, you have no life in you:</hi> which words, <hi>if you take according to the letter, this letter killeth,</hi> saith Origen; <hi>but it is the spirit</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>that quickeneth, the flesh profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing, the words which I speake unto you, they are spirit, and they are life, Iohn,</hi> 6.63. He that pierceth the barke, and commeth to the sap, runneth not from the tree of life, but rather run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to it: so doe we when we leave the <hi>barke</hi> of the letter upon necessary occasions, and <hi>pierce into the heart,</hi> and draw out the <hi>sap</hi> of the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meaning. To presse the letter of Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the spirituall meaning and analogie of faith, is not onely <hi>Iewish</hi> but <hi>Haereticall.</hi> For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, The <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> ground their hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie upon plaine and expresse words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: from which to use the <hi>Iesuits</hi> owne words, <hi>All Orthodox Divines are faine to flie to figurative and tropicall interpretations.</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> To the third. First, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith not, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, not <hi>in which Epistles of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. Paul, but in which points and heads of doctrine many things are hard to be understood.</hi> Secondly, though some points be hard to be understood in themselves, or are obscurely set downe in Scripture, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not from thence, that all things necessary to salvation are not plainely delivered therein. For, as before I proved out of Saint <hi>Austine</hi> and Saint <hi>Chrysostome, Among those things which are
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:177104:316"/> plainly delivered in Scriptures, all such points are found as containe faith and manners, all things that are necessarie are manifest.</hi> Thirdly, those things which are obscurely set downe in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, may be, and are elsewhere in holy Scriptures more perspicuously delivered. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith not, that those things are <hi>hard to be understood</hi> simply, and to all men; but <hi>to the ignorant and unstable, who wrest all Scripture to their owne destruction.</hi> Among which number, the <hi>Iesuit</hi> must reckon himselfe and his associates, before they can fit this text to their purpose.</p>
                     <p>To the fourth. First, this passage out of Saint <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> hath beene discussed before, and cleered; where I shewed, that it maketh nothing against, but strongly for the sufficiencie of Scripture, to instruct in all points necessarie to salvation. For, though all Christs speeches and actions are not registred by the Evangelist, yet as Saint <hi>Austine</hi> rightly inferreth out of the words following, <hi>(haec scripta sunt ut credatis &amp; credentes vitam aeternam habeat is) electa sunt quae saluti creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium sufficerent:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.15.</note>
                        <hi>Such things were made choice of to be written, as might suffice for the salvation of all Beleevers.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. <hi>2.</hi> And Paul as his manner was went unto them of Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonica, and three sabbath dayes reasoned with them out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> Neither is that text of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> any whit derogatorie to the perfection of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for whatsoever hee meanes by Tradition <hi>(per Sermonem)</hi> taught by word of mouth, it is certaine out of the seventeenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that all Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> speech and discourse to the <hi>Thessaloinans,</hi> whereunto the words have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:177104:317"/> reference were out of Scripture. Secondly, the words themselves, <hi>Tenete traditiones quas dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cistis sive per sermonem, sive per Epistolam;</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port not that the Apostle delivered divers things to them in writing by an Epistle, and without writing, by word of mouth: but that he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them, and taught them the Christian doctrine both wayes, by Letters, and by speech: and that they should have as much care of his writings, as of those things hee spake to them in presence. Thirdly, admit they were different things which hee spake to them, and which hee wrote: all that can be from thence inferred, is but this, that all points of saving Doctrine are not written in this Epistle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians:</hi> which may be granted without any prejudice to our Tenet. For those things that are not written in that Epistle, might be, and undoubtedly are written in other of his Epistles, or other bookes of holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> To the fift. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> is not against the free use of Scripture in the vulgar tongue, for hee himselfe translated the Scriptures into the vulgar tongue of the <hi>Dalmatians;</hi> hee dedicates his Commentarie upon Scripture to Lay-persons, yea many of them to women: whom he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,<note place="margin">Haec monilia in pectore, haec in auribus he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reant.</note> to <hi>account them as their chiefe casket of Iewels; let these Iewels hang upon your neckes, and in your eares, Epist. ad Demetriad:</hi> wherein hee much commendeth the Husbandmen about <hi>Bethlem,</hi> for being so perfect in Scriptures, that <hi>They had

                     </p>
                     <p>To the sixt. This practise of the <hi>Iewes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth nothing at all, but that those passages of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Scripture above mentioned are very difficult, and subject to misconstruction; and therefore require a discreet Reader of ripe yeares, and judgement. Whether this their practise be commendable or no, in restraining all before they arrive to thirty, from reading those passages of Scripture, I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not: but this is certaine, that even this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of theirs which the <hi>Iesuit</hi> brings against us, makes for us; for they permitted all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:177104:318"/> thirty, to reade all other chapters of holy Scriptures, and after thirty, these also.</p>
                     <p>To the seventh. The honour the Papists doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the Scriptures, in prohibiting them to be read, is like the favour she did her Paramour in the Poet, <hi>Quae prae amore exclusit foras,</hi> which <hi>out of pure love thrust him out of doores.</hi> The greatest honour wee can doe Gods holy Oracles, is diligently to reade them, attentively to heare them, humbly to obey them, and daily to search them, as the deeds and evidences of our salvation;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.39.</note> according to the Precept of our blessed Saviour, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them yee thinke yee have eternall life, and they are they which testifie of mee.</hi> As for the <hi>Iesuits</hi> reason, drawne from the weaknesse of the Readers, it is very weake, and of no force at all.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 19 7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.4.</note> First, because the Scriptures were written <hi>to give knowledge to the simple, and wisedome to the unlearned.</hi> Secondly, because if this his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son were good, their Church should prohibit all other bookes as well as Scriptures, or rather much more than Scriptures, in regard there are errours in them, but none in Scriptures: and God hath promised a speciall blessing to those, who in obedience to his ordinance, diligently reade and study the holy Scriptures, which hee hath not to those that reade other books.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> To the eight. This Proverb might most right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have beene applied to the <hi>Iesuit</hi> in the former Section, when he, a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> produced <hi>Oliverius Manerius</hi> a Jesuit, against <hi>Henry Buxhorne,</hi> Deane
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:177104:318"/> of <hi>Tyelmond,</hi> then hee said in effect, Aske my brother Jesuit if I be a thiefe, or rather a slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. But it no way fitteth <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> and the <hi>Knight,</hi> the one being a zealous Protestant, the other a professed Papist, though discovering, and ingeniously confessing divers abuses in the Papacie. If hee were as the <hi>Iesuit</hi> sayes, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, because hee wrote of Art-magicke; what were Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> and <hi>Sylvester,</hi> who not onely studied, but also practised the black-Art, as <hi>Benocardinalis, Platina,</hi> and others write.</p>
                     <p>To the ninth. The <hi>Iesuit</hi> will not stand an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> every one severally, because hee dare not keepe that station for feare of Gun-shot. For the answer hee giveth in generall, it is false and absurd, if not impious: false, because it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that those similitudes cannot be applied to the letter onely, without the meaning; nor doe the Heretikes now a dayes, nor did the Devill himselfe alleage onely the letter and syllables of Scripture, but the meaning also,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.16.</note> though perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and wresting it to an evill end, and drawing false conclusions from it. Hee that calleth the Scriptures <hi>Sybils Prophecies</hi> blasphemously car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth at the obscuritie of the meaning: and <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hius,</hi> who compared it to a nose of wax, impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously taxeth the diversitie of senses, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which the Scripture is subject unto in it selfe. Lastly, the <hi>Iesuit</hi> taketh himselfe by the <hi>nose,</hi> in saying, Heretikes in all Controversies run to the letter of the Scriptures, leaving the true
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:177104:319"/> sense, and spirituall meaning: for so doe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists apparantly, namely, in the Controversie of Supremacie, <hi>Ecce duo gladii; Loe here two swords:</hi> therefore the Pope hath the temporall and spirituall Sword at command. <hi>Peter, rise up, kill and eate:</hi> therefore the Pope hath power to put Princes to death. In the question about the number of Sacraments, they alleage the letter of that text in the vulgar translation, <hi>Hoc est mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Sacramentum,</hi> to prove marriage a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereas the Apostle in the same place saith, that hee speaketh not of corporall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of a man and his wife: but of the spirituall marriage of Christ and his Church. Likewise in the Controversie about the reall presence, they <hi>run to the letter, Except yee eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood:</hi> though Christ in the same place expounding himselfe, saith, <hi>The words which I have spoken unto you, are spirit and life:</hi> the like may be observed in other Controversies. For answer to all which texts, wee tell him out of Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> whom himselfe quoteth in the next Paragraph; <hi>That the Gospell consisteth not in the words of Scripture, but in the sense: not in the superficies or barke, but in the pith: not in the leaves of speech, but in the root of reason.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> To the tenth. How neere neighbours the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists are to <hi>Marcion,</hi> who denied, or by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, overthrew the truth of Christs humaine nature; as the Papists doe in the Sacrament, vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him under the outside, or accidents of a round
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:177104:319"/> wafer; and what affinitie the <hi>Iesuit</hi> hath with the rest of the ancient Heretikes, the <hi>Knight</hi> shewed him before in his seventh Section: and if hee desire to know more of his pedegree from them, I referre him to an Appendix to <hi>Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> answer to <hi>Sanders</hi> his Demonstration, <hi>page</hi> 801. As for the aspersion of old Heresies, which hee casts upon us, they are washed away by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Morton,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Field,</hi> in their Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Church, <hi>Ad notam sextam.</hi> But why hee denies that wee have the Spirit, arrogating it onely to himselfe, I see no reason but the pride of his owne spirit, together with the malice of the evill spirit, who suggested unto him this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable censure of us.</p>
                     <p>To the eleventh. The Scripture is a <hi>Light, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Psal.</hi> 119. and the nature of a light is, first to discover it selfe, and then all things else: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Calvin</hi> to his fond question, how know you Scripture to be Scripture? answereth acutely by retortion, how know you the Sun to be the Sun? If hee say, by his bright lustre and beames; wee say the same of holy Scripture, that it is discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by its owne light. Which, if the Papists see not, the fault ought not to be laid upon the Sun-beames, but upon their Owles eyes.</p>
                     <p>To the twelfth. That rule which needeth any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> thing to be added to it, is imperfect: but all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists teach, that to the written Word unwritten Traditions must bee added to make a compleat and perfect rule of Faith: all Papists therefore
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:177104:320"/> teach, the Scripture alone to be an imperfect Rule. We on the contrary stand for the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Scripture, and constantly and unanimously defend that not onely the whole Scripture is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but that every part also hath its owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but not the perfection of the whole. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the eyes have not the perfection of the whole head; or the head, the perfection of the whole body; a man cannot conclude, that the eye, or the head is imperfect: no more can the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit</hi> conclude that the Gospell of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> or Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> are therefore imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, because they containe not in them all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines in particular necessary to salvation. It is sufficient that they together with the rest, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly instruct us in all points of faith: by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they perfectly informe us so farre as the Holy Ghost intendeth, that we should be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by each of them in particular, and this is their perfection, that they have no defect in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or forme, and that they concurre with the rest of the bookes of Scripture, to the maine end of the Holy Ghost in committing the word of God in writing, for the infallible and perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Church, and every faithfull soule in all Doctrines needfull to salvation.</p>

                     <p>To the first.

If he should thus argue in the Schooles: Pope <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane</hi> the eighth, in the yeare of our Lord, 1633. held the <hi>Trent</hi> faith, and beleeved Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth his Creed: therefore the 33. Bishops that suffered Martyrdome under the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours within 300. yeares after Christ, held the same faith, and subscribed to the same Articles of <hi>Trent;</hi> he would be stampt at, and hissed out by all present; for who knoweth not that <hi>George</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> immediatly succeeded <hi>Athanasius</hi> the most Orthodox Bishop, and that all the <hi>Arian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in <hi>Constantius his</hi> time, held the Sees of those Orthodox Bishops, who in the first Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at <hi>Nice</hi> condemned that blasphemous haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.

                        <hi>and</hi> John? <hi>To say nothing of the rest, it is manifest, that in</hi> Peter <hi>all the rest are contained.</hi> This prayer then no more privilegeth the See of <hi>Rome</hi> from error, than of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> or of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> or any other See of the Apostles.

                     <p>To the fift. If it be no matter of Faith, that this particular Priest Transubstantiateth the Bread, because no man knowes his intention, nor that particular Priest, <hi>Et sic de caeteris:</hi> It followeth, that it is no matter of Faith to beleeve, that any Priest in the Roman Church, by the words of Consecration, turneth the Bread into Christs Body. As for that, hee
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:177104:328"/> addeth, that it is no matter whether any ever died for this point in particular; I answer, it is a matter of great moment: for if <hi>Garnet</hi> would not take it upon his salvation, that this Bread hee consecrated, immediately before he death, was turned into Christs Body; nor any ever would, or did pawne his life for Transubstantiation: it is evident, that Papists themselves doubt of the certainty of that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. On the contrarie, wee can produce hundreds, nay thousands, who for denying Transubstantiation, have beene put to death, and have signed the truth of the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches, concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with their blood: and therefore the Doctrine of the Protestants in this point, is of more credit than the contrarie, because it is strengthened and fortified by a <hi>Noble armie of Martyrs.</hi>

For thus they <hi>whet their sword,</hi> and <hi>shape</hi> it on the <hi>Protestant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile:</hi> Protestants <hi>confesse, at least, many of them, that there may be salvation in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church; but</hi> Papists <hi>absolutely deny that there may be any salvation in our Churches:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fisher relation of a <hi>3.</hi> confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note>
                        <hi>therefore it is safer to come to theirs, then to stay in ours; to be where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all grant salvation, then where the greatest part of the world deny it.</hi> Hereunto the <hi>Knight</hi> truely and solidly answers.</p>
                     <p>First, that our <hi>Protestant</hi> Tenents are of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:177104:330"/> that the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves cannot pretend with any probability, that there is any danger in them, but rather in the contrary; as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it evident by eight remarkeable instances.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that our Religion is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the worse, but rather the better for our charitable opinion of our Adversaries: for true piety is ever joyned with compassionate charity.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that though we leave the persons of <hi>Papists</hi> to their and our judge,<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>14.4.</hi> What have I to doe to judge another mans servant, seeing he standeth or falleth to his owne master?</note> not pronouncing damnation on them, as they doe on us: yet we proclaime confidently to all the world, that their doctrine is not safe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, he distinguisheth also the persons of <hi>Papists,</hi> some are invincibly ignorant, who are compelled to resigne up their own eye-sight, and to look through such Spectacles as their <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> have tempered for them; for these poore soules if they make as good use as they can of the publike and private means afforded them for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge, and hold fast the Articles of the Apostles Creed, without opposition to any ground of Christian Religion; and furthermore have a minde and purpose to obay God, and keepe his Commandements, according to that measure of knowledge and grace which they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and live for outward things in the unity of the Church where they dwell, much may be said: other live under Princes and States, who as Gods true Watchmen and Shepherds, desire they should be better informed, and take care,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:177104:330"/> that they may have meanes to be instructed in the true saving knowledge of Christ; such <hi>Papists</hi> shutting their eyes against Gods light, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in their ignorance, and saying in effect, <hi>Wee will not the knowledge of thy wayes, Iob</hi> 21.14. goe not safely out of the world. How the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit</hi> refuteth these answers, wee shall see in the examination of his particular exceptions.</p>
                     <p>To the first. That cannot be farre from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                        <hi>Knights</hi> purpose, which agreeth with the title of his whole Booke, <hi>Via tuta,</hi> The safe Way: this safe way hee proves to be the Protestants way by divers instances, in which the Papists af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation is dangerous, but our Negation cannot but be safe. For example, there is apparant dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in maintaining the adoration of Images, and the creatures of Bread and Wine in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: because it is expressely forbidden under many fearfull curses; to offer Sacrifice, burne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, or exhibit any Divine Worship to any save God onely, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 97.7. <hi>Confounded be all they that worship graven Images, and boast themselves of Idolls:</hi> but there can be no danger in not <hi>Worshipping the Creature insteed of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, who is blessed for ever, Rom.</hi> 1.25. They are in danger of a curse that forbid Marriage, and hold it in some persons to be unlawfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane; which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth, <hi>The Doctrine of Devils,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 3. But there can be no danger in not prohibiting Marriage in any, which is <hi>Honorable in all, and the bed undefiled,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:177104:331"/> Heb.</hi> 13.4. They are in danger who equall Traditions with Scripture, because it is written, <hi>Cursed be hee that addeth or taketh away from the words of the Law, or the Gospell, Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22.18. There is danger in confidence in our owne merits; because, <hi>Cursed is hee that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arme, Ier.</hi> 17.5. but there can be no danger in not relying upon our owne merits; for <hi>Blessed are they that trust in Christ,</hi> and him onely, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 2.12. for that the Cardinall himselfe confesseth to be <hi>Tutissimum.</hi> There is danger in taking away the Cup from the Laity, for it is a violation of Christs insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; for Jesus said unto them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.53. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee eate the flesh of the Son of man, and drinke his blood, yee have no life in you:</hi> but there can be no danger in not taking away the Cup from the Laity, but reaching it to them; for <hi>Whosoever eateth Christs flesh, and drinketh his blood, hath eternall life,</hi> vers. 54. There is danger in keeping the Scriptures from the Laity; for <hi>The people perish for want of knowledge:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.6.</note> and <hi>God powreth his wrath upon the people that know not his name:</hi>

                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 79.6.</note> but there can be no danger in permitting them to <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them they have eternall life, Ioh.</hi> 5.39. and, <hi>Blessed are they whose delight is in the Law of the Lord, and that exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in that Law both day and night, Psal.</hi> 1.2. There is danger in praying in an unknowne tongue; for they which doe so, <hi>Worship they know not what; draw neere to God with their lips,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:177104:331"/> but their hearts is farre from him:</hi> but there can be no danger in Service in a knowne tongue; for the Apostle saith, <hi>I will pray with the spirit, I will pray with understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, I will sing with understanding also,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. It was a curse inflicted upon the builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> that they understood not what was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: and the gift of tongues hath beene ever esteem'd a singular blessing conferred upon the Church, whereby the people of all Nations and Countries understood the Apostles, and their Successors preaching to them, and praying for them.</p>
                     <p>To the second. I reply, that all his answers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are refuted in my Animadversions upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapters, onely some Cavils hee addeth, which I will answer in a word.</p>

The words which the <hi>Iesuit</hi> would make seem so ridiculous, are related by the <hi>Knight,</hi> as their owne words not ours, as any may perceive by the Preface to them, <hi>therefore say they,</hi> and by this that they are written in a lesser Character, and is it not senslesse in the <hi>Iesuit,</hi> and most ridiculous to laugh at himselfe, and put his owne nonsense upon the <hi>Knight,</hi> who taking the <hi>Iesuits</hi> words as he found them, scorning to nible
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:177104:341"/> at syllables, interpreted the <hi>Iesuits</hi> words at the best, and taking his meaning, joynes issue with him upon the point in this manner. <q>In a Church professing Christianity, where the Scriptures of the old and new Testament are received, and the two Sacraments instituted, by Christ admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, suppose we there to be two sorts of Professors, either publikely allowed as in <hi>France,</hi> or at least tollerated, as in other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, both these entituling themselves to be members of the pure Orthodox Church, and neither of them having beene particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in any generall Councell, received through the Christian world; the probleme then is, whether of these two, that party is not in the safer way, who holdeth no positive Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of faith, to which both parties (besides all other Christians) give not their assent unto: then the other who maintaineth twelve Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith at least, wherein they themselves stand single, and are forsaken by all Christians, not onely of the reformed Churches, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France, Germany, Denmarke, Swethland, Norway, Poland, Transylvania,</hi> but also in the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Churches dispersed through the large Dominions of the <hi>Turke</hi> in <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> But thus it standeth betweene us and Papists, all the positive Articles which we hold necessary to salvation, they themselves, and all other Christian Churches in the world assent unto: whereunto the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:177104:342"/> many other positive Articles in joyning all under paine of damnation to beleeve them; in all which additions, she standeth alone by her selfe: therefore it is safer to adhere to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and faith of the reformed Churches, then the Pope his new <hi>Trent</hi> Creed.</q> The <hi>Iesuits</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions against this argument are very idle, and all his instances in <hi>Turkes, Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Haeretikes,</hi> nothing to the purpose: for the unbeleeving <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> never were, nor yet are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholike Christian Church: the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Nestorians, Eutychians,</hi> and <hi>Marcionites</hi> have beene long agoe excluded out of the true Church of Christ, and their Haeresies are by name condemned in ancient generall Councells approved by the whole Christian world. These therefore come not within the verge of the <hi>Knights</hi> proposition, which is restrained to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches, and such whose Tenets have not in particular as yet beene cryed downe, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured as erroneous in any oecumenicall Councell: among such, doubtlesse those are in the safer way, who hold nothing for an Article of faith necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to salvation, which is not clearely deduced out of Holy Scripture, and assented unto, even by the opposite part, whose testimony, saith the <hi>Iesuit,</hi> Page 498. <hi>must needs proceede from evidence of truth.</hi>

Remission of sins is obtained by repentance, righteousnesse by a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faith, and sanctifying grace by hearing dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently the Word, duly receiving the Sacraments, and daily practising such religious duties as are prescribed in the Word.</p>
                  <p>These are good preparations in generall to a comfortable end, and a happy dissolution; but in speciall, I commend unto you at this time, these three following:
<list>
                        <item n="1">1. To consider your later end, and comment often upon your owne death.</item>
                        <item n="2">2. To meditate upon Christs death.</item>
                        <item n="3">3. To expresse them both to the life, by mortifying your fleshly members upon earth.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meditation of death is of singular use, for it killeth sin in us, and either quite taketh away, or much diminisheth the feare of death. As the stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a dead hand on the belly, cureth a tympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; and as the ashes of a viper, applied to the part that is stung, draws the venome out of it: so of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:177104:355"/> ashes of a sinner, wee may make a soveraigne Salve against Sin, after this manner: Dost thou let loose the raines to thy impetuous lusts, and art given to licentious pleasures? lay the ashes of a voluptuous person to thy heart, and say, all our sinfull delights and pleasures, all our mirth and laughter, is but like <hi>the crackling of thornes under a pot,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.6.</note> which will turne in the end into ashes and mourning. Art thou a <hi>Narcissus,</hi> or <hi>Nireus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured with thine owne beauty? take of the ashes of a beautifull person, now rotten in the grave, and lay them to thy heart, and say, such as these stinking ashes and foule earth are, I shall be. Art thou inclined to luxurie, or gluttonie? take of the ashes of a glutton, and lay them to thy heart, and say, this is all that remaines of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Fare, to make a small quantitie of foule earth, or ashes good for nothing, I have spent so much in pampering of my flesh. Lastly, art thou high minded, and puffed up with pride? lay the dust and ashes of a proud man to thy heart, and say, this man that walked so stately, and looked so high, here lyeth low enough, and is trod upon by every begger that walketh over his grave. Such thoughts as these, are excellent sawces to season the pleasures of this life, that wee surfeit not of them. In which regard, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it was, that the Aegyptians usually served in a Deaths-head, with a shovell full of mold at their greatest Feasts, with their first course: and <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> built his Sepulcher in his
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:177104:355"/> garden: and lest the Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the height of their honour, and pride of their glory, should forget the frailty of their condition, and vilenesse of their nature, the ancient manner was at their Inauguration, to shew to them divers sorts of Marble, and bid them chuse of which they would have their tomb-stone made. A like ceremonie is used at this day, in the Inthroniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope; before hee is set in his chaire, and puts on his triple Crowne, a piece of toe, or wadd of straw is set on fire before him, and one appointed to say, <hi>Sic transit gloria mundi;</hi> the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of this world is but <hi>a blaze.</hi>
                  </p>

Even children, though they are much scared at the first, with the sight of a vizard; yet after they have looked stedfastly on it, and handled it, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no hurt at all in it, they make themselves sport with it: even so the child of God, the first time the devill representeth to him the gastly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of death, is terrified with it, it is as a <hi>Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare,</hi>

The Sonne of God paid this tribute to nature, shall I that am a servant stand upon it? The King of glorie entred into his Kingdome by this gate, shall I desire to avoid it, or feare to follow him? My Redeemer, when hee was nailed hand and foot to the Crosse, incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Death, then armed with a deadly sting, and hee disarmed it, left it as good as dead; and shall I feare to deale with an enemie so conquered and spoiled?

If you pricke or cut a piece of dead flesh, it shrinketh not at it, it feeleth no paine: no more is a mortified man affected with the panges of death; What feareth he to depart out of the body, which he account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no better then the prison of his soule? what careth he to leave the world at his death, who abandoneth it all his life? what passeth he for the losse of temporary delights and pleasures, who never accounted them delights or true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures? but rather in regard of sinne adhering to them,<note n="k" place="margin">Bernard me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditat. c. <hi>13.</hi> Accusat me cōscientia testis est memoria ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio judex, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptas carcer, timor, tortor, oblectamentum tormentum, nam inde patimur unde delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</note>

                     <hi>is in a straight betweene two, having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ which is farre better.</hi> To assoyle this doubt, we must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish first <hi>quomodo</hi> in what respect, or how; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>quare,</hi> for what cause or end; thirdly,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:177104:359"/>
                     <hi>quatenus,</hi> how farre forth death may be desired.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>quomodo?</hi> death is no way to be desired as a punishment of sinne, but as a period of sinne: not as it is in his owne nature, but as it is changed by Christ: not as it is a posterne gate to let out our temporall, but a streete dore to let in eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>quare?</hi> for what end or cause death is to be desired, not to ease us of the burthen of any heavy crosse laid upon us: not to free us from our painefull or dangerous imployments; but either that we may be discharged from sinne, and severed from the company of the wicked: or that we may be more nearely united unto Christ, and more fully enjoy him then we can in this life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>quatenus?</hi> how farre forth. No man may absolutely desire death, but with submission to Gods will who is Lord of our life, to whom we ought to commit our soules as our faithfull Creator.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the second question, it hath beene much argued by Phylosophers, and not a little by Divines. The Stoicks generally taught that life was a thing indifferent, and that it made little matter <hi>whether death come to us, or we come to it.</hi>
